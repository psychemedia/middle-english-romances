Introduction

The ancient minstrels, as a body, were editors and publishers, rather than original composers. They had to perform duties which, in these days, are divided amongst various caterers for the public in matters of taste. The office of minstrel was neither that of poet, editor, actor, nor musician, but a compound of all. To him it was indifferent where, or how, he acquired the tales, which it was his business to enact or recite, and upon which his popularity and living depended ; generally speaking, we may imagine that it was a safer game to repeat well-known and popular stories, than to try a doubtful hazard with something new, or original. At the same time, it would be most desirable to give to the old tales an air of novelty, by introducing appropriate variations, and that he should, as far as possible, accommodate to his hearers, what had, perhaps, been composed for their fathers or grandfathers. ...

But the minstrels were also representatives of publishers

[translated from Latin by Google Translate:]

You know indeed this vulgar and vulgar kind, who live by the words of the agents, and not by their own, which among us has grown to the point of disgust. There are men not of great genius, but of great memory, and of great diligence, but of greater boldness; they frequent the halls of kings and potentates, naked of their own, but clothed in the songs of others, and while what has been said by this or that more exquisitely, especially in a maternal character, they pronounce with great expression, the favor of the nobles, and they ask for money, and clothes and gifts. And the instruments of this kind of living, now from others here and there, now from the inventors themselves, are either bought at a price, or at a price, if at any time the desire or poverty of the seller demands it;

He is hungry, untouched by Paris unless he sells Agaven.

And these, indeed, whenever you think of me, I believe the same to others, they are politely put into the harbor, and they are troublesome, although now less often than usual, either out of respect for a changed interest and happiness, or out of repulsion. For they often get used to the fact that they are not boring, I deny it vehemently, and I do not bow down to any insistence. except at the hour of the shortest time, burdensome; and there were some of these who had been won over by my prayers, having obtained their vows; they, indeed, but otherwise naked and destitute, had gone away, not long after they returned to me clothed in silks, and laden and rich, and gave thanks that they had cast off me a heavy burden of poverty: by which I was sometimes so moved , in order to make a rare appearance of alms, I had resolved to deny myself such to no one; Moreover, when I inquired of some of these, why they always sought me and not others, and you in the first place, for these things, that you should give such an answer, and that you had often done what I said to them, and that nothing had ever come of it. you would have existed in a park, and to add to this, that you had also burned whatever vulgar poem you had turned to, which did not diminish my admiration, but added a little to it. And when I inquired of them the cause of your act, I confessed ignorance of all, except one who said that he thought, I do not know whether he had even heard, that it was in your mind to reform all these things to a young man first, after and to a youth that had passed away, to the present solid and already gray mind. " Rerum Senilius, Lib. V. Ep. 3. p. 7 93. [END TRANSLATE]

How far this description may apply to the minstrels of the north, it would be, perhaps, presumptuous to say ; the internal evidence of some of the Metrical Romances goes far to prove that they were composed in the Cloister, and, like the poems which Petrarch gave to his friends the Troubadours, must have been given to the minstrel to publish, *aut prece aut pretio* ["either by prayer or by price"].

The three poems now printed very probably formed part of the stock of some individual of this by-gone pro¬ fession. They have been apparently written from recita¬ tion, and are remarkable for the complete contrast of matter, style and diction. The first two or three pages have evidently been taken down by one who was not in¬ timate with the form of the stanza ; some lines are di¬ vided, and some run into each other, just as we might suppose would be the case till the writer had made him¬ self acquainted with the intricacies of the versification. A professed minstrel, or even a person who had read the poem through, would have avoided such irregularities.

It may be too, that the recitation of these and similar productions, was accompanied by something of dramatic action, as the “ he- sayd,” and <c ho sayd,” are very fre¬ quently additions which the metre itself will not allow

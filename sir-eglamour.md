SIR EGLAMOUR OF ARTOYS.

The following abstract is taken from Garrick's PJays, K. 10, which was printed " at London in Fobter-iane, at the sygne of the Hartes home, by John Walley." Another printed copy is preserved in the Bodleian. There are three MSS» copies of this romance, one of which is in the Cotton library, Calig. A. 12; another in the public hbrary Cambridge, No. 690 ; and a third in Bishop Percy's folio.

The writer tells us in the last stanza, that "in romaunce this chronicle is;" so that Mr Ritson can have had no good reason to doubt its bcins: a translation, merely because the French original has not yet been discovered. The same remark will apply to Sir Triamour. — It contains 214 stanzas of six lines.

But Crystabell was not ambitious. Educated in her father's court, she was naturally partial to its inhabitants, and among these there was a young knight to whom she was more partial than to the rest, either because he was handsomer, or because at the numerous tournaments which Prinsamour had ordered to be proclaimed in her name, and which had drawn together a large concourse of strangers, he had uniformly been victorious. He was a native of her father's dominions, and his name was Sir Eglamour.

The young knight, on his part, had always heard that Crystabell was the most charming of her sex J and he had no sooner beheld her than

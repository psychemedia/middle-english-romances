 Comment upon the Wife of Bathes Tale.

Prince Arthur ^ the Son of Vther^ bom in Gomioal^ was Crowned King of Britain in the Year 616. He was a Prince, for Spirit no less Couragious, than in all his Attempts Victorious. His Courage proclaimed him a man, and his good Fortune an happy man. He fought twelve several Battels against the Saoeons, and alwaies returned Conqueror. And having now to his succeeding memory reduced his Countrey to quietness, and planted the Peaceful Olive in his Confines ; to express his true Love to Chivalry, and memorize such who were not only Associates, but Assistants in his Victory ; He constituted the Order of the Bound Table, in which Order, he only retained such of his Nobility, as were most Eenowned for Vertue and Chivalry. This Eound Table he kept in divers places, especially at Carlton, Winchester, and Gamalet in Somersetshire. In memory of which Foundation, by the Testimony of Leyland, there is yet to be seen in Denbighshire, in the Parish of Llansavan, in the side of a Stony Hill, a place artificially compos'd, wherein be four and twenty Seats for men to sit in, some less, and some bigger, according to their several Statures ; cut out of the main Eock by man's Hand ; where young people coming to seek their Cattel, use to sit, play, and repose : They commonly call it Arthur' ^ Eound Table. To insist on those Fabulous Eolations which former times have broached touching this Prince, I will not, but refer them, who take delight in the Eeport of such Wonders, to our Old Wives Legends. Let it suffice them, that in this King's daies (if they will take the word of a good Old Wife of Bath)

King Oberon, Queen Mah^ Prince Gncket, and his Paramour Pig- Widgeon, with all their fair Company, used to repair hither, and dance a Cinque-pace upon the Meads, (if they had so much Art among them) Yea, by usual resorting and consorting together, they became so famOiar with our Milkmaids on the Downs, as they would not only sport with them, but woo them and win them } whence the Poet ;

But this (saith our Wife of Bath) was many hundred Years ago. King Oberon^B Race is quite extinct and gone, or else confined to some other remote Island, where they reside. And she gives a Beason of this.

There is no other Incubus but he. Neither need they fear any Dishonour; for nothing but holy Honesty attends the Frier.

Amongst others of his Princely Retinue, for whom only this brave Victorious Prince reserved his Round Table, one Lusty Youth there was in his Court, who giving Eeins to his Desire, encountred a young amorous Maid, and ravish'd her; The Report of this Rape within few dales came to King Arthur*^ Ear, who, to expiate the GuHt of

so foul a Crime, and free his Royal Court of all Dishonour, denounced upon this wanton Courtier due Censure: Which Censure (as may he probably conceived) was grounded upon the Statute then, as now in Force; That he who committed any Rape should suffer Death. Albeit, in those daies, an especial kind of Death was inflicted on the Ravisher, and that was, he should lose his Head; to counterpoize this Offence, in depriving another of her Maiden-head,

As it hath been ever accounted the highest Honour for Knights to afford succour and relief to distressed Ladies, so hath it been the custom of Noble and Affable Ladies to commiserate the IMiss- fortunes or Overtures of dejected Knights. Such Favour found this young Gentleman at the Hands of his Queen and her Ladies: who, no sooner heard of this Judgment of Deatli pronounced upon him, than with Prayers and Tears (prevalent Suitors to a compassionate Prince) they labour'd to reverse that Sentence, and afford some comfort to his approaching Ruine. As they prayVl, so they prevailM ; The King (a Mirror in his time, both for Justice and Mercy) gives this Knight's Life to his Queen, to dispose of, as shall best like lu^r. Kor need he fear ought else than a gracious Usage at her Hands, from whose Sollicitancy he had received his Eeprieve, if not Eeversal of Judgment.

^he xjimie thauketh thi king toith all her might ^nb after thi^, thus s^iake she tjo the knight <fec.

The Queen, after due thanks rendered unto the King, for speeding so well in her Suit, takes Opportunity to talk with tliis Knight ; and tels him how, indeed, by her means, she had Y>i'<^cur'd his Reprieve for a time ; but yet he was not to hold himself safe nor secure from danger. His Life was given her, and she Avould bestow it on him, provided that he performed what she propounded, and assoile<l wliat she demanded.

 necessary Caution for this condemned Gentleman. As if she should say, Go to Sir, your Fact was hainons, for which you have here your Sentence. The Sentence of Death, you know, to be already pronounced ; to attemper the sharpness of which Censure, I have interceded for you ; and so far prevailed, as it is now in my hands whether you live or die. Nor is my Brest so steeled, as altogether insensible of Compassion. Yet must such a Crime as you have committed, sustain the difficulty of some Task before it be remitted. This Question then you must resolve me, if ever you niean to expect any Favour Jrom me. It concerns our Sex, as from our Sex you are to acknowledg the Benefit of your Life.

If the Question seem too intricate, I will give you a twelvemoneths time to consider of it ; yet with Sureties for your Eeturn at the Years end. Go to, this is all the Favour I will shew you. WiQ toa0 the knight, ani) 0X>rx>i»fttUB he ^iketh.

Mightily perplexed was this distressed Knight \ but seeing there is no Eemedy, but he must either assoil this Question, or despair of Safety; he prepares himself for his Journey. Wherein, you may suppose, what Coasts he frequents, with what people of all Qualities and Conditions he consorts ; he leaves no place unsought, where he conceives the least hope that this Question may be assoil'd.

As many Men so many Minds. A whole College of Physicians had not more different Opinions; Nor all the antient Philosophers more discrepant Tenets concemiug Felicity. Some said it was Riches that did most delight them. Others thought Honours did most content them. Others held that Gorgeous Attire did highliest take them. Some said Mirth, others said Delight in Bed, others to be Widows oft. Some, and those of the self-same Sex (for who knows better their hearts than themselves) taking compassion of this poor perplexed Knight, and desirous to satisfie him in what they could, unriveted the very Secrets of their own Brests, and told him

1 Wher-as he mighte finde in this matere (L 67) Two creatures accordinge in-fere.

plainly what of all things in the world they for their parts most desired, and what of all others most contented them. For my part, said one, there is nought that delights me more, than to have Heartsease, to be cheared, cherished, flattered and pleas'd ; ever to have my Words seconded, my Arguments maintained, and in all my Business to have my self duly attended. Another of the same Sex, and for her Opinion, by all likelihood of the same Sect, starts up, and affirms] That for her part, she lov'd nothing better, tlian to be free and at her own Dispose ; to be countermanded by none, to do what she list ; not to be reproved for any Vice that she loved ; to be esteemed wise ; more free than nice ; more buxom than precise.

Here this Good-wife oi Bath puts in her Vye, and confirms tlieir Opinion, who held that nothing delighted a Woman more than to be soothed, seconded, and humored. Eor whosoever (saith she) use to claw us on the Gall, or nettle us, they shall find us to have Stomachs. We cannot endure tp be controlled ; give us the Swinge, or they that oppose us, are sure to be swinged. Again, If wo be subject to any Yice, we cannot brook that any other's Eye should prie into our Bosoms, When we are lightest, we desire to be held demurest ; when most Vitious, to be reputed most Vertuous. They are lovVl most by us, who defend our Vices ; They offend us most, who stile not our Vices Vertues.

Mida, quad MiyScv lioXwv, because his Eies were blinded or filmed with Covetousness. He was King of Phrygia, and one of the richest that ever reign'd. The Poets feign, that after he had restored JSUentis unto Baec7iiis, to gratilie his Courtesie, Bacchm promised him what Gift soever he should demand ; Upon which 0£Fer, he desired that whatsoever he touched, might be into Gold turned. By which means, the very Meat which was provided for his Eepast, became Gold ; so as, though he surfetted in Gold, he famished for Food, Well then deserved he an Asses Ears for his Labour, who could not satis fie his Desires without starving Kature. Kow to cover this Deformity (as may be supposed) he wore purposely long Hair, so as none knew of it, save only his Wife, whom he especially trusted, and to whose Secrecy those long Ears of his were only disclosed. She, who had solemnly vow'd never to disclose what he had recommended to her Trust ; both to keep her Oath, and yet disgorge her Stomach of that Secret, which lay so fretting and frying on her, as she must needs be delivered of it ; resolved one day to go down to a Marish near adjoyning, far remote from the sight or search of man ; where, just like as a Bittern puts his Beak in a Eeed, and through the hollowness of the Cane makes a shrill and sharp sound, so lay Midas Wife with her Mouth to the Water, using these Words ; Dost thou hear, tltou Marish 1 my Husband has a pair of Asse's Ears ; This is a Sea^et, none hut my self knows of it; I would not for a world impart it. So, now my Heart is eased : My Lace would have broke^ if I had not disclosed it,

This Story you may read in the Eleventh Book of his Metamorphosis, where the Eeason of this Transformation is lively expressed.

Many Coasts and Countries had this distressed Knight searched, sundry Folkes Judgments and Opinions had he sought, yet is he no nearer, than when he began. Different were their Conceits, according to the Difference of their Minds. Nothing was definitely concluded, because their Judgments were so diversly distracted. On draws the time, in which his Summons cals him home ; which, rather than he will not keep, in regard of those dear Friends Words engaged for him, he resolves to suffer a thousand Deaths. Thus perplexed, wanders this Pilgrim Knight, hopeless of any Resolve for his Question, and consequently out of all hope to procure his Pardon.

Amidst these distracted Cares of his, as he travels homeward (for approached was the time of his Eetum, with a general Expectance of his Besolve) as he casts his troubled Eye aside, he sees a Company of dainty and delicate Ladies, Sylvanes or Wood-]N'ymphs all, leading a pleasant Dance near to the Forrest side ; Towards them he addresseih his Course, in hope to receive some Comfort from them. But to increase his Anguish, no sooner draws he near them, than they vanish.

Beauty was gone, and Deformity left. All those amiable Ladies were quite vanished ; and none remaining but an old Hag, whose sight begot in him more Loathing than Loving. Those, whom former times have painted out for the most ugly, and worst-favoured Creatures that ever breathed ; even iVays, Catctstes^ Tkestylis^ were dainty Paragons in Nature.*

His time limited is so short, and so speedy his Task, as it admits no delay. He discovers unto her the reason of his Eaunge in that' desert and unfrequented Forrest, The Question that he is injoyned to assoil upon pain of Life, he declares unto her. Albeit small Comfort he expect from her. This he no sooner imparts, than she returns from this unexpected Answer to bring him back to himself, from this high-beat Path of his approaching Danger.

The preciousest Ear-Eing that ever he wore. What he had sought for among so many Beauteous Damosels, in so many frequented places, in such eminent Courts, and could never attain, he finds now in the Brest of an old withered Hag, in a wild Forrest, far remote from the Seat or Sight of men. Suppose him then, thus provided, now approaching the Court, where he is expected according to his Day limited, to return his Answer, where he is either to come off with Honour or Danger.

A great Assembly of women are purposely come to Court to hear this Knight's Answer, and to give their Judgments, as may be thought, whether this Question to him proposed, were by him truly or no resolved. A general Silence by an O Yes, thrice publickly cried, was to all Women injoyned. A Task, I grant of no small difficulty, but this was, to th' end this Knight should not be interrupted. The Knight, after his Appearance, and so free Audience,

* 'Have heer my trouthe/ quod the knight, *I grante.' (1. 157). ^ 'Thanne,' quod she, ' I dar me wel avante/ (1. 158}. * AVith-outen lenger speche (1. 164).

with a shrill Voice and stout Spirit, as one confident of his Answer, assoiles the Question with this Eesolution :

There is nothing which a woman desires more than Soveraignty ; Command is her Content ; Dominion her Minion ; her will her Weal. This the Poet confirms :

Nor Love^ nor Life, nor lAherty, nor Landy Can please a Wenckf unless she have Command,

Soveraignty is such a Pearl in her Eye, that Life is a loathing unless it be attending. Thus hath he returned his Answer ; now hear what Applause it receives in this fair Foeminine Assembly,

In all the conxt nas there toife ne tnaib^ £it toibxrto, that r^antrarieb that he 0aib ^ttt 0atb, he toa0 to^rthg han hie life.^

By general Voice and Vote he is held worthy to have his Life. Their own Bosoms else would have condemned them, and netled the old rivell'd Hag, from whom he received that Answer, and who all the time had been silent, to have stirred her glib Tongue among them. Now imagine, after this Question so fully resolved, and the whole Court of Women ready to be dissolved, with what unexpected Joy this Late perplexed Knight was transported; which, (behold the Mutability of all Earthly Comforts, ever sweeter in Ambition than Fruition) was as quickly exiled, by another OccurrentTwhich now succeedeth,

No sooner was this Question resolved, the Knight pardoned, and all ready to depart, than up starts this old Trot, and appeals to the Queen, who sate as Chief Justice; to whom she exhibits her Petition, after that, like another Omphada^ she had unnimbly rushed down upon her four Quarters, and in her best homely manner had

* Read * kille * and ' wille.'

done her Reverence : " Madam, I am an old woman, and so must " youngest here be, if they live to't ; yet an old woman deserves her " due as well as the youngest : This gay Knight, simply though I " stand here, was taught by me his Answer : for which he plighted " me his Troth, that whatsoever I should demand at his Hand, if it " lay in his power, he would perform.

You shall not say, Sir Knight, that I love you ill ; both to save your Life, and procure you a Wife, is no mean Courtesie. I mean to bestow no worse than my self on you; and many a poor Knight would be heartily glad of a worse Choice. You know Promise is Debt ; nor can you pay your Debt, unless you tender your self.

She puts him to his Book-Oath, but he will neither take it, nor her by his goodwill. He must now turn over a new Leaf, and act another fresh Scene of Sorrow. For, thinks he, if Life be nothing without Society, what may that Life be worth, where he must live with her whom he eternally loths 1 Thus to live were to die ; yea to die were to live, rather than embrace such a Life, Better thinks he, it had been by many Degrees, to have stood Mute, and submitted himself to the extreamest Censure, than upon such hard tearms to have procured an Answer, the issue whereof will undo him for ever. He resolves then to make her a fair Proffer, the Acceptance whereof, though it should make him a Beggar, yet in his Conceipt infinitely happier.

As if he should say, I confess freely, that I have received an incomparable Courtesie from you ; being the next Means under God and my Gracious Soveraign, of preserving my Life ; Nor will I deny but I promised you upon the Answer I received from you, whatsoever were in my power, I would freely and without exception give you. But little did I expect that my self should be the Gift. Alas ! You are an old Woman, and should think of other matters, than such youthful Marriages. For what would this beget but Jealousie in you, Discontent in me, and some miserable End to us both ? This ^ * Nay than,' quod she, * I shrcwe us bothe two ! * (1. 206),

Disparity in our Years, can make no true Harmony in our Affections. Age, generally is more given to the World, than the Flesh : Accept then of my Fortunes, I lay them down at your Feet, and leave me to the wide world to raise me an Estate. I have nothing too dear for you but my self; release me of that, and take all. This, he thought would have prevaiUd, but he is far deceiv'd ; She expressly answers him, that it was not his Fortunes that coxdd content her ; 2^0, nor all the precious Ore, Metals, nor Minerals of the whole Earth. As his own Life was by her means saved, so expects she that his own Person shall recompense it. Set your heart then at rest, saith she, as you received from me the Benefit of your Life, so nothing will content me but being your Wife and your Love.

My Love, my loathing I Hanging and wedding go by destiny, and he holds it disputable, whether his loss of life or choice of such a Wife, were the greater Misery. He holds MartiaJF^ opinion in his affiance to this woman.

He could be the better contented to marry her, if he were but persuaded that he should shortly become her Survivor ; mean time, this is his conceipt ; though, he received from her the benefit of his life, yet he holds his life at too high a rate to be enthralled to her love. Neither, as he verily thinks, would this disgrace which he should thus incur, by ingaging himself to this unweldy Beldame, who was a very fardel of Diseases, reflect only upon himself, but on his whole iN'ation : For to describe her, and bestow on her her true Character, what was she, but a sapless seer stock without verdure ; a crawling creeping Cricket, without vigour ; a proportionless feature without favour ] One, whose mouth like a common sewer, was ever driveling ; whose Kose, like a perpetual Limbeck, was ever dropping. The Sciatica had taken Possession of her Hip ; the Megrim of her Head ; An aged Film had quite covered her Eyes ; And an incessant Cough taken seizure of her Lungs. Her Mouth was discharged of the Grinders ; from which issued such a Steam, as it would have put a Serjeant in mind of his Mortality. Yet must this proper Puss be this Knight's dainty Bride ; For howsoever he hold himself highly disparaged, his Nation dishonoured, his succeeding Hopes eternally dashed ;

Now some (saith this old Wife of Bath) will perhaps expect that I should speak of the Joy and Jollity, Feasts and Solemnity of this goodly Marriage, As first, how the Bride and Bridegroom were attired, with what Companies attended, what Dainty Gates were provided, how the Feasters were ranked, with what Musick and Melody cheared.

They that expect any jovial Day at such a Bridal-Day, are much deceived ; There was nothing there but Pouting, Louring, and Cloudy Weather j All things were out of temper; l^o Consort could keep any Concord, when the Chief of the Feast were at such mortal Discord. They that came to their Table, might be sure to find store of Foul in every Comer ; Foul Looks, Foul Lips, Foul Linnen. Well may we think then ;

Sure my Guilt cannot be so great, but if you look on the Means of your Safety, that will excuse me ; But if I have been in ought blame-worthy, do but impart it, and I shall amend it. Amend it (quoth the Knight) that's impossible. When I look on thy Deformity, it makes me quite forget the means of my Safety. Thy Presence makes my Bed loathsom; thy Old Age and base Birth make my Life wearisom. Ko wonder then, if I thus toss, turn and turmoil my self, when I see no Object that may afEord to my restless Misery the least Hope of Comfort. Burst then, poor hapless Heart, since thou art destitute of all Hope, and deprived of all Means of Help.

Well Sir, these are no such great Eyesores, but they might be cured ; yea, and before three Daies were expired, if you demeaned your self towards me as became a Loving Husband. But whereas you stand so much upon Gentility of Blood ; Trust me, sweet Spouse, these Titles are but Trifles. Those only are to be held generous, who are Vertuous ; those Ignoble, who are Vicious. Nobility of Blood, if it want inward Worth, is soon corrupted ; and the highest Family without Vertue, stained. It is true, we derive from our Ancestors our Descents, yet if we come short of them in Deserts, we more dishonour them, than we are honoured by them. Eor howsoever they confer on us their Inheritance, they cannot leave us their Goodness; That must be by our own Endeavours obtained, not to ns Lineally derived. He is a right Gentleman, that has gentle Conditions ; from whence he took his Kame, as it agreed best with his Nature.

Here this old Woman shews her self graced with inward Worth, though she want outward Farts, in a free Delivery of her Eeading both in Poetry and Philosophy. Wherein she first repeats Daunfs Divine Sentence, how we are to attribute all glory unto God, from whom we receive not only outward Prowess, but all inward Goodness. From our Elders, we may receive Fortunes and Temporal Blessings, which usually prejudice most, where they are possessed most : But for inward Abilities, it is not in their power to derive them to us, nor bestow them on us. And he gives the Eeason, which he confirms with a Familiar Instance : For, saith he, Should Goodness be derived lineally, then where there is any goodness in the Ancestor, it should diffuse and propagate it self to all his Family ; ^one that descended from him, should be addicted to any Yillany : There would be an Heritage of Goodness in the whole Linage. Just as Fire, should you carry it into the darkest Cell betwixt Heav'n and Frozen Caucasusj yet would it, according to its Natural Quality and Operation, give Light and Heat ; The Darkness of the House could neither obscure nor extinguish it ; till what fed it were consumed, and so it self became quenched. But it is far otherwise with Gentry; it derives no such Native Motion nor Operation from her Family.

As Bastard-Slips take seldom deep Boot, so the freest and most generous Plants bring not alwaies forth most Fruit. The hope fullest Cyens are oft-times most degenerate. Catiline and Cethegus were a shame to their Fathers ; So were Semphronia and Lucilla to their Mothers. He or she then (saith this Moral Bride) that would be accompted Generous, let him be Vertuous ; He cannot be a Gentleman, that is not endowed with a Gentle Mind. Be he or she never so nobly Descended, if Debauched, they are but Peasants. Neither can we justly challenge to our selves any Honour from our Ancestors, if we second them not in Actions woilihy the Eenown of those Ancestors. It is neither Priority of Place, nor Nobility of Kace, that deserves Approving, but Gentleness and Affability, which from God have their sole Beginning.

Lib, 7. C. 4.

by Valerivs M<mmm^ was the third King of the Romans^ a Prince of Singular Sobriety, a singular Observer of all Vertues ; Insomuch as his own Goodness raised him to that Greatness. His Poverty could not keep him from Imperial Dignity, because the Eyes of all good men were upon him ; by whose general SuflTrage he was elected, and to a Begal Seat advanced. Peruse likewise the Works of Seneca and Boetius, two Authors most sententiously Divine, and you shall find (saith this old Bride) that it is gentle Deeds that make one truly Gentile. By all which, she expressly concludes, that an Honourable Descent infers not ever Eminence of Desert ; For as one may be Low-bred and well dispos'd, so may one be High-born, and ill*afiected.

Secondly, Whereas you seem so much to tax me for my Poverty; That Condition is rather to be loved, than reproved. He who may be a Pattera to us all for Imitation, preferred voluntary Poverty before any other Condition. Neither may we think would He have chus'd it, if there had been any Evil in it. The Philosopher saith. To be silent in Prosperity, chearful in Adversity, in both to shew an Indifferency, is the higliest Pitch of Philosophy. It is the Saying of Sage Seneca^ and other Learned men, That he only is Prosperous and Happy, who contents himself with his Poverty ; Admit he be not worth a Shirt to his back, he has Wealth enough, who holds himself content. He is the richest, whose Desires are fewest; He the poorest, whose Wishes are fullest. There is no Poverty but Sin properly. Juvenal speaks merrily:

1 Grante me grace to Uven vertuoiisly. (1. 318.)

2 R^ad 'povert.'

He thafs so poor he is not worth a Ghvat^ Before a Thief may sing a meiiry Note,

Yea, to describe more fully the Excellency of Poverty ; It is a Soveraign good, though generally hateful, inwardly fruitful. An expedite Dispatcher of Business \ For howsoever we pay for Expedition in these Courts on Earth, this is that leads us in the expeditest Course to the Court of Heaven ; It enlighteneth our Understanding, enliveneth our Conceiving, rectifieth our Judgment, if in these Gusts of seeming Affliction we be patient. These, and many other excellent Fruits produceth Poverty, though few or none entertain it willingly, Nay, which is more, it brings Man to the Knowledg of himself, and of God, who, for his Love to Man, humbled himself. Besides, It is a very clear Mirror or Looking-Glass, wherein he may distinguish Friends from Foes, and try whom he may safely trust, Eeprove me then no more (Gentle Sir) for my Poverty ; nor grieve your self at that which brings with it more Comfort than Misery.

Lastly Sir, Whereas you despise me for mine Agej If no Authority did enjoyn you, nor no Book inform you, that Age were to be reverenced, even your own Gentility would exact this from you, and that inbred Civility which Nature hath planted in you. When you see an Old Man, for the Eeverence you bear unto his Age, you clepe him Father. Will you contemn me then, because I am like your Mother) In this respect, you should rather cherish, than discourage me, honour, than disparage me.

Now whereas you still cast in my Dish, mine Age and Deformity ; This you may use for an Antidote against Jealousie. When you are ahroad, you need not fear me j Affection is grown so cold in me, it can work no strong Effects on my Phantasie. Neither will any one desire much to court me, for my Deformity, Decrepit Age and want of Beauty, are sufficient Guardians to preserve Chastity. For as Age is ever attended on by Honour, it is with more Reverence loved than lusted after.

But go too Sir ; I see these pleas will hardly please. The Bride that lyes by you must be beautiful or she will not content you. Beauty is a dainty Pearl in your eye. Well ; you shall have your desire : There is nothing that may delight you, wherein I will not satisfie you, if it be in my power to grant you. Go to then, I will offer to your choice two things, wherein please your self, and you shall please me who am your second self. First is, whether you will have me aged and deformed as I now am ; and so find me an humble, loving, and affable Wife, unwilling to displease you, ready at bed and board to be disposed by you, in all respects conformable unto you. Or else, you will have me young and fair, and subject your self to the hazards of beauty. For well you know, that as youth is sooner tempted, so is beauty soonest tainted. I cannot avoid it but I must have Suitors to court me. Servants to comfort me, dainty Didappers to visit me. Your house must be alwayes open to Strangers, mine arms to embraces, my perf um'd Lips to youthful Kisses.

The world is well amended ; Wow when it is in his choyce, he stands indifferent for her Change. Yet could he find in his heart that she had Beauty, so none might share with him in her Beauty. But Jealousie is such a dangerous Malady, as to prevent all occasion, he will content himself with her Deformity, rather than become subject to so cureless an Infirmity. First therefore he here adviseth, then sigheth, lastly thus concludeth : Albeit, Dear Wife, you may imagine what Comfort it would be to me to enjoy ^ Beautiful Bedfellow ; one whose outward Parts might make her honoured whereever she resorted ; and whose sweet Society might allay my Distasts, and improve my Comforts whensoever occasioned ; yet shall not you find me so drenched or drowned in sensual Delights, as to prefer mine own Appetite before the Light of Eeason. I understand by your grave and discreet Arguments, that you are wise, which is to be incomparably valued above all outward Beauty. Make choyce then of what may seem best in your own Discretion ; I will in no wise give way to my own blind Affection ; which of these two soever may tender you most Pleasure and Honour, chuse it, and so dispose of me and it, as your Honour may be most advanced by it. I shall hold my self content whether of these two you accept.

Now what she so long aim'd at, she has got ; her own Will ; and therein, which may seem more strange, his Happiness. You have given me, saith she, the Mastery; which shall be such a Government, as it shall not have the least tast of Tyranny. This you have done so freely, as it injoins my Usage to be friendly.

But now I shall take from you all Occasion of Doubting, and make you happy in your Affection. For I will be to you both Young and Beautiful \ and withal so constant in my Love, so Continent in my Desires, so Moderate in my Delights, so Temperate in my Resolves, so Discreet in my Directions, so Vertuously Good and Gracious in all my Actions, as you shall find your Happiness fully Crowned in enjoying me. Nor will I feed your Hopes with any long Delay j For by the next Morning, shall my Beauty be such, as no Lady from East to West may compare with me ; whereof, with my Life, dispose as may best please you.

Howsoever it be said, that they both slept ; It is probably to be doubted, whether he, at least, slept or no. Such a longing desire lie had to see this approaching Hour of her Transmutation. But when this happy Hour was approached, Aurora her burnished Beams dispersed, and the Curtain drawn aside, by which this Brides Beauty might be discerned; it is not to be imagined how strangely this over-joyed Bridegroom was intranced. Straight- waies he inwreaths her in his Arms, looks Babies in her Eyes : and as one embathed in Bliss, a thousand times a row he kisseth her, meerly transported with joy for the Beauty he saw in her.

Here at last this good Old Wife of Baih ends her long Relation with a serious Supplication ; By which she shews that she has one Colt's Tooth yet left ; !N'either doth she pray only for her self, but for the whole Congregation of her Sex: That they may have Husbands MeeJc^ to live with, Young, to love with, and Fresh, to lie with ; That they may ever be their Survivors ; That such Husbands may have short Lives, who will not sulfer their Wives to be Grovernors; And that a Pestilence may light on all such Husbands and Niggardly Cot-queans as cannot dispose of their own, but are Misers. And so ends she her Story to make her Audience merry. Thus then will we conclude our Comment, and recount the Comical Passages of their I?"uptial Content, woven up in these Verses.

Nor longer than ſhe ſhed her Horns they ſtaid, c From thence with airy Flight to foreign Lands convey'd, Above the reſt our Britain held they dear,

More ſolemnly they kept their Sabbaths here,

And made more ſpacious Rings, and revell'd half the

I ſpeak of ancient Times, for now the Swain Returning late may paſs the Woods in vain, And never hope to ſee the nightly Train:

1'o ſkim the Bowls, and after pay the Feaſt. She ſighs and ſhales her empty Shoes in vain, No Silver Penny to reward her Pain:

For Prieſts with Pray'rs, and other godly Gcer, Have made the merry Goblins diſappear ;

And where they pla\'d their merry Pranks before, Have ſprinkled Holy Water on the Floor :

And Fry'rs that through the wealthy Regions run Thick as the Motes, that twinkle in the Sun; Reſort to Farmers rich, and blefs their Halls, And exerciſe the Beds, and croſs the Walls:

This makes the Fairy Quires forſake the Place. When once *tis hallow'd with the Rites of Grace: But in the Walks where wicked Elves have been, The Learning of the Pariſh now is ſeen,

So ſtrait ſhe walk'd, and on her Paſterns high:

If ſeeing her behind he lik'd her Pace,

Now turning ſhort he better lik'd her Face :

He lights in Haſte, and, full of youthful Fire,

By Force accompliſh'd his obſcene Deſire:

This done away he rode, not uneſpy'd,

For ſwarming at his Back the Country cry'd;

And once in View they never loſt the Sight,

But ſeiz'd, and pinion'd brought to Court the Knight. Then Courts of Kings were held in high Renown,

Ere made the common Brothels of the Town :

There, Virgins honourable Vows receiv'd,

But chaſte as Maids in Monaſteries liv'd :

No bad Example to his Poets gave:

And they not bad, but in a vicious Age,

Had not to pleaſe the Prince debauch'd the Stage. | Now what ſhou'd 4r:hur do? He lov'd the Knight.

But Sovereign Monarchs are the Source of Right.

Mov'd by the Damſel's Tears and common Cry,

He doom'd the brutal Raviſher to die,

But fair Genexra roſe in his Defence,

And pray'd ſo hard for Mercy from the Prince;

That to his Queen the King th* Offender gave,

And left it in her Pow'r to kill or ſave:

Some ſaid the Sex were pleas'd with handſome Lies, And ſome groſs Flatt'ry lov'd without Diſguiſe :

Truth is, ſays one, he ſeldom fails to win

Who flatters well, for that's our darling Sin,

But long Attendance, and a duteous Mind,

Will work ev'n with the Wiſeſt of the Kind.

One thought the Sexes prime Felicity

Was from the Bonds of Wedlock to be free :

Their Pleaſures, Hours, and Actions all their own,

And uncontroll'd to give Account to none.

Some wiſh a Huſband-Fool; but ſuch are curſt,

For Fools perverſe, of Huſbands are the worſt ;

All Women wou'd be counted chaſte and wile, Nor ſhould our Spouſes ſee, but with our Eyes; For Fools will prate; and tho? they want the Wit To find cloſe Faults, yet open Blots will hit: "Tho? better for their Eaſe to hold their Tongue, For Womankind was never in the Wrong. So Noiſe enſues, and Quarrels laſt for Life ; The Wife abhors the Fool, the Fool the Wife. And ſome Men ſay that great Delight have we, To be for Truth extolPd, and Secrecy : And conſtant in one Purpoſe ſtill to dwell; And not our Huſband's Counſels to reveal. But that's a Fable, for our Sex is frail, Inventing rather than not tell a Tale. Like leaky Sives no Secrets we can hold: Witneſs the famous Tale that Ovid told,

Midas the King, as in his Book appears,

By Phabus was endowed with Aſſes Ears, Which under his long Locks he well conceal'd, (As Monarchs Vices muit not be reveal'dꝰ? For Fear the People have 'em in the Wind,

Who long ago were neither Dumb nor Blind ;

Nor apt to think from Heav'n their Title ſprings, Since Jode and Mars left off begetting Kings. This Midas knew ; and durſt communicate

To none but io his Wife, his Ears of State:

One muſt be truſted, and he thought her fit,

As paſſing prudent; and a parlous Wit.

To this ſagacious Confeſſor he went,

And told her what a Gift the Gods had ſent:

But told it under Matrimonial Seal,

With ſtrict! junction never to reveal.

The Secret heard, ſhe plighted him her Troth, (And ſacred furc is every Woman's Oath)

'The Royal Malady ſhould reſt unknown,

Both for her Huſband's Honour and her own: But nebercheleſs ſhe pin'd with Diſcontent; The Counſel cambled till it found a Vent. | The Thing ſhe knew ſhe was oblig'd to hide; : By Int'reſt and by Oath the Wife was ty'd ;

But if ſhe told it not, the Woman dy'd.

But ſhe muſt burſt, or blab; and no Pretence Of Honour ty'd her Tongue from Self defence. A marſhy Ground commodiouſly was near, 'Thither ſhe ran, and held her Breath for Fear, Left if a Wo d ſhe ſpoke of any Thing,

That Word might be the Secret of the King. Thus full of Counſel] to the Fen ſhe went, Grip'd all the Way, and longing for a Vent: Arriv'd, by pure Neceſſity compell'd,

On her majeſtick Marrow- bones ſhe kneel'd:

Then to the Waters-brink ſhe laid her Head, And, as a Bittour bumps within a Reed, To thee alone, O Lake, ſhe ſaid, I tell (And, as thy Queen, command thee to conceal) Beneath his Locks the King my Husband wears A goodly royal Pair of Aſſes Ears: Now I have eas'd my Boſom of the Pain, Till the next longing Fit return again !

Thus through a Woman was the Secret known; Tell us, and in Effect you tell the Town. But to my Tale: The Knight with heavy Cheer, Wandring in vain had now conſum'd the Year : One Day was only left to ſolve the Doubt, Yet knew no more than when he firſt ſet out. But home he muſt: And, as th' Award had been, Yield up his Body Captive to the Queen, In this deſpairing State he hap'd to ride, As Fortune led him, by a Foreit-fide : Lonely the Vale, and full of Horror ſtood Brown with the Shade of a religious Wood : When full before him at the Noon of Night, (The Moon was up and ſhot a gleamy Light) He ſaw a Quire of Ladies in a Lond: That featly footing ſeem'd to ſkim the Ground: Thus dancing Hand in Hand, ſo light they were, He knew not where they trod, on Earth or Air. At Speed he drove, and came a ſudden Gueſt, [

Then ſ:id, What make you Sir ſo late abroad Without a Guide, and this no beaten Road ? Or want ycu ought that here you hope to find, Or travel for ſome Trouble in your Mind? The laſt I gueſs; and, if I read aright,

Thoſe of cur Sex are bound to ſerve a Knight: Perhaps good Counſel may your Grief aſſwage, Then tell your Pain: For Wiſdom is in Age.

To this the Knight: Good Mother, wou'd you know.

The ſecret Cauſe and Spring of all my Woe?

My Life muſt with 'T'o-mcrrow's Light expire, Unleſs I tell, what Women moſt dehre :

Now cou'd you help me at this hard Eſſay,

Or for your inborn Goadneſs, or for Pay; Your's is my Life, redeem'd by your Advice, Aſk what you pleaſe; and I will pay the Price: The proudeſt Kerchief of the Court ſhall reſt Well ſatisfied of what they love the beſt,

Plight me thy Faith, yum ſhe, That what I aſk, Thy Danger over, and perform'd the Taſk ; | That ſhalt thou give for Hire of thy Demand, Here take thy Oath ; and ſeal it on my Hand;

I warrant thee, on Peril of my Life,

Thy Word ſhall pleaſe both Widow, Maid and Wife.

More Words there needed not to move the Knight To take her Offer, and his Truth to plight. With that ſhe ſpread her Mantle on the Ground, And, firſt enquiring whither he was bound, Bade him not fear, tho' long and rough the Way, At Court he ſhould arrive ere break of Day:

His Horſe ſhould find the Way without a Guide, She ſaid : With Fury they began to ride,

He on the Midſt, the Beldam at his Side.

The Horſe, what Devil drove cannot tell,

But only this, they ſped their Journey well :



And all the Way the Crone inform'd the Knight, How he ſhould anſwer the Demand aright. To Court they came: The News was quickly ſpread Of his returning to redeem his Head. The Female Senate was aſſembled ſoon, With all the Mob of Women in the Town: 'The Queen ſate Lord Chief Juſtice of the Hall, And bad the Crier cite the Criminal. The Knight appear'd ; and Silence they proclaim, Then firſt the Culprit anſwer'd to his Name: And after Forms of Law, was laſt requir'd To name the Thing that Women moſt deſir'd. Th' Offender, taught his Leſſon by the Way, And by his Counſel order'd what to ſay, Thus bold began; My Lady Liege, ſaid he, What all your Sex deſire is Sovereignty, The Wife affects her Huſband to command, All muſt be hers, both Money, Houſe, and Land, The Maids are Miſtreſſes ev'n in their Name; And of their Servants full Dominion claim. This, at the Peril of my Head, I ſay, A blunt plain Truth, the Sex aſpires to ſway, You to rule all; while we, like Slaves, obey. There was not one, or Widow, Maid, or Wife, But faid the Knight had well deſerv'd his Life, Ev*n fair Geneura, with a Bluſh, confeſs'd The Man had found what Women love the beſt. Upſtarts the Beldam, who was there unſeen, And Reverence made, accoſted thus the Queen My Liege, ſaid ſhe, before the Court ariſe, May I poor Wretch find Favour in your Eyes: To grant my juſt Requeſt : * Twas I who taught The Knight this Anſwer, and inſpir'd his Thought. None but a Woman could a Man dire& To tell us Women, what we moſt affect.

But firſt I ſwore him on his knightly Troth, (And here demand Performance of his Oath) To grant the Boon that next I ſhould deſire; He gave his Faith, and I expect my Hire:

My Promiſe is fulfill'd: I ſav'd his Life,

And claim his Debt to take me for his Wife. The Knight was aſk'd, nor cou'd his Oath deny, But hop'd they would not force him to comply. The Women, who would rather wreſt the Laws, Than let a Siſter-Plaintiff loſe the Cauſe,

(As Judges on the Bench more gracious are, And more attent to Brothers of the Bar)

Cry'd, one and all, the Suppliant ſhould have Right,

And to the Grandame-Hag adjudg'd the Knight. In vain he ſigh'd, and oft with Tears deſir d,

Some reaſonable Suit might be requir'd.

But fill the Crone was conſtant to her Note;

The more he ſpoke, the more ſhe ſtretch'd her Throat.

In vain he proffer'd all his Goods, to ſave

His Body, deſtin'd to that living Grave.

The liquoriſh Hag rejects the Pelf with Scorn : And nothing but the Man would ſerve her Turn. Not all the Wealth of Eaſtern Kings, ſaid ſhe, Have Pow'r to part my plighted Love, and me: And Old, and Ugly as J am, and Poor,

Yet never will I break the Faith I ſwore ;

For mine thou art by Promiſe, during Life, And I thy loving and obedient Wife.

My Love! nay rather my Damnation thou, Said he: Nor am I bound to keep my Vow : The Fiend thy Sire has ſent thee from below, Elſe how coud'ſt thou my ſecret Sorrows know ?

The Queen may take the Forfeit of my Head, Ere any of my Race ſo foul a Crone ſhall wed,

Avaunt old Witch, for I renounce thy Bed :

Both heard, the Judge pronounc'd againſt the Knight;

So was he marry'd in his own Deſpight;

And all Day after hid him as an Owl,

Not able to ſuſtain a Sight ſo foul.

Perhaps the Reader thinks I do him Wrong,

To paſs the Marriage-Feaſt, and Nuptial Song : Mirth there was none, the Man was a-la-mort : And little Courage had to make his Court,

'To Bed they went, the Bridegroom and the Bride : Was never ſuch an ill-pair'd Couple ty'd.

Reſtleſs he toſs'd and tumbled to and fro,

And rowl'd, and wriggled further off, for Woe, The good old Wife lay ſmiling by his Side,

And caught him in her quiv'ring Arms, and cry'd, When you my raviſh'd Predeceſſor ſaw,

You were not then become this Man of Straw ;

Had you been ſuch, you * have ſcap'd the Law.

Is this the Cullom of King Arthur's Court?

Are all Round-Table Knights of ſuch a Sort!

Remember I am ſhe who ſav'd your Life,

Your loving, lawful, and complying Wite ;

Not thus you ſwore in your unhappy Hour,

Nor I for this Return employ'd my Pow'r,

In Time of Need I was your faithful Friend;

Nor did I ſince, nor ever will, offend,

Believe me, my lov'd Lord, *cis much unkind ;

What Fury has poſſeſs'd your alter'd Mind ?

Thus on my Wedding-night—Without Pretence—

Come turn this Way, or tell me my Offence.

If not your Wife, let Reaſon's Rule perſuade,

Name but my Fault, Amends ſhall ſoon be made,, Amends ! Nay that's impoſſible, ſaid he,

What Change of Age or Uglineſs can be

Or, could Medea's Magick mend thy Face,

Thou art deſcended from ſo mean a Race,

That never Knight was match'd with ſuch Diſgrace.

But firſt I ſwore him on his knightly Troth, (And here demand Performance of his Oath) To grant the Boon that next I ſhould deſire; He gave his Faith, and I expect my Hire: My Promiſe is fulfill'd: I ſav'd his Life, And claim his Debt to take me for his Wife.

Or, could Medea's Magick mend thy Face,

Thou art deſcended from ſo mean a Race,

That never Knight was match'd with ſuch Diſgrace

What Wonder, Madam, if I move my Side, When, if I turn, I turn to ſuch a Bride?

And is this all that troubles you ſo ſore! And what the Devil cou'dſt thou wiſh me more? * Ah Benedicite, reply'd the Crone: Then Cauſe of juſt Complaining have you none. The Remedy to this were ſoon ap ly'd, Wou'd you be like the Bridegroom to the Bride. But, for you ſay a long deſcended Race, And Wealth, and Dignity, and Pow'r, and Place, Make Gentlemen, and that your high Degree Is much diſparag'd to be match'd with me; Know this, my Lord, Nobility of Blood I; but a glitt'ring and fallacious Good: The Nobleman is he whoſe noble Mind

Ts fill'd with inborn Worth, unborrow'd from his Kind.

The King of Heav'n was in a Manger laid;

And took his Earth but from an humble Maid : Then what can Birth, or mortal Men, beſtow ? Since Floods no higher than their Fountains flow. We, who for Name and empty Honour ſtrive, Our true Nobility from him derive.

Your Anceſtors, who puff your Mind with Pride, And vaſt Eftates to mighty Titles ty'd,

Did not your Honour, but their own, advance: For Virtue come not by Inheritance.

Tf you tralineate from vour Father's Mind, What are you elſe but of a Baſtard-kind ?

Do, as your great Progenitors have done,

And by their Virtues prove yourſelf their Son. No Father can infuſe, or Wit, or Grace,

A Mother comes acroſs, and marrs the Race.

A Grandſire, or a Grandame, taints the Blood; And ſeldom three Deſcents continue Good, Were Virtue by Deſcent, a noble Name

Cou'd never villanize his Father's Fame :

But, as the firſt, the laſt of all the Line, Wou'd like the Sun ev'n in Deſcending ſhine. Take Fire; and bear it to the darkeſt Houſe, Betwixt King Arthur's Court and Caucaſus, If you depart, the Flame ſhall till remain, And the bright Blaze enlighten all the Plain : Nor, till the Fewel periſh, can decay, By Nature form'd on Things combuſtible to prey. Such is not Man, who mixing better Seed With Worſe, begets a baſe degen'rate Breed: The Bad corrupts the Good, and leaves behind No Trace of all the great Begetter's Mind. The Father ſinks within his Son, we ſee, And often riſes in the third Degree; If better Luck, a better Mother give: Chance gave us Being, and by Chance we live. Such as our Atoms were, ev'n ſuch are we, Or call it Chance, or ſtrong Neceſſity, ; Thus, loaded with dead Weight, the Will is free. And thus it needs muſt be: For Seed conjoin'd Lets into Nature's Work th' imperfect Kind:? But Fire, th' Enliv'ner of the general Frame, Is one, its Operation ſtill the ſame. Its Principle is in itſelf: While ours Works, as Confederates War, with mingled Pow'rs ; Or Man, or Woman, which ſo ever fails : And, oft, the Vigour of the Worſe prevails. Atber with Sulphur blended alters Hue, And caſts a duſky Gleam of Sodom blue. Thus in a Brute, their ancient Honour ends, And the fair Mermaid in a Fiſh deſcends : The Line is gone; no longer Duke or Earl; But, by himfelf degraded, turns a Churl. Nobility of Blood 1s but Renown Of thy great Fathers by their Virtue known, And a long Trail of Light, to thee deſcending down

If in thy Smoke it ends: Their Glories ſhine ;

But Infamy and Villanage are thine.

Then what I ſaid before is plainly ſhow'd,

The true Nobility proceeds from God:

Not left us by Inheritance, but giv'n

By Bounty of our Stars, and Grace of Heav'n,

Thus from a Captive Servins Tullus roſe,

Whom for his Virtues the firſt Romans choſe ; Fabritius from their Walls repell'd the Foe, Whoſe noble Hands had exercis'd the Plough. From hence, my Lord, and Love, I thus conclude, That tho* my homely Anceſtors were rude, Mean as I am, .yet I may have the Grace

To make you Father of a generous Race:

And Noble then am I, when I begin,

In Virtue cloath'd, to caſt the Rags of Sin:

If Poverty be my upbraided Crime,

And you belie.e in Heav'n, there was a Time When he, the great Controller of our Fate, Deign'd to be Man, and hv'd in low Eſtate: Which he who had the World at his 2 If Poverty were Vice, wou'd never chuſe. Philoſophers have ſaid, and Poets ſing,

That a glad Poverty's an honeſt Thing. Content is Weaith, the Riches of the Mind; And happy he who can that Treaſure find, But the baſe Miſer ſtarves amilft his Store, Broods on h's Gold, and griping fill at more, Sits ſadly pining, and believes he's Poor. The ragged Beggar, tho' he wants Relief, Has not to loſe, and ſings before the Thief. Want is a bitter and a hateful Good, Becauſe its Virtues are not underſtood:

Vet many Things, impoſſible to Thought, Have been by Need to full Perfection brought:



The daring of the Soul proceeds from thence, 8 Sharpneſs of Wit, and active Diligence: Prudence at once, and Fortitude, it gives, And, if in Patience taken, mends our Lives; For ev'n that Indigence that brings me low, Makes me myſelf, and him above, to know. | A Good which none would challenge. few wou'd chuſe, A fair Poſſeſſion, which Mankind refuſe. If we from Wealth to Poverty deſcend, Want gives to know the Flatt'rer from the Friend, It Iam Old and Ugly, well for you, Noleud Adult'rer will my Love purſue, Nor Jealouſy, the Bane of marry'd Life, Shall haunt you, for a wither'd homely Wife : For Age, and Uglineſs, as all agree, Are the beit Guards of Female Challity. Yet ſince [| fee your Mind is wordly bent, I'll do my Beſt to further your Content. And therefore of two Gifts in my Diſpoſe, Think ere you ſpeak, I grant you Leave to chuſe: Wou'd you I ſhould be ſtill deform'd, and Old, Nauſeous to Touch, and Loathſome to behold ; On this Condition, to remain for Life A careful, tender and obedient Wife, In all I can contribute to your Eaſe,

And not in Deed, or Word, or Thought, diſpleaſe ?

Or would you rather have me Young and Fair, And take the Chance that happens to your Share ? Temptations are in Beauty, and in Youth, And how can you depend upon my Truth? Now weigh the Danger, with the doubtful Bliſs, And hk yourſelf, if ought ſhould fall amiſs. Sore ſigh'd the Knight, who this long Sermon heard: At length, conſidering all, his Heart he chear'd ; And thus reply'd: My Lady, and my Wife, To your wiſe Conduct I reſign my Life:

Chuſe you ſor me, for well you underſtand The future Good and Ill, on either Hand: But if an humble Huſband may requeſt, Provide, and- order all Things for the beſt ; Your's be the Care to profit, and to pleaſe: And let your Subject-Servant take his Eaſe.

Then thus in Peace, quoth ſhe, concludes the Strife, Since I am turn'd the Huſband, you the Wife: The Matrimonial Victory is mine,

Which, having fairly gain'd, I will reſign; Forgive, if I have ſaid, or done amiſs,

And ſeal the Bargain with a friendly Kiſs:

] promis'd you but one Content to ſhare,

But now I will become both Good, and Fair. No Nuptial Quarrel ſhall diſturb your Eaſe, The Buſineſs of my Life ſhall be to pleaſe : And for my Beauty that, as Time ſhall try ; But draw the Curtain firſt, and caſt your Eye.

He look'd, and saw a Creature heav'nly Fair,  
In bloom of Youth, and of a charming Air,  
With Joy he turn'd, and seiz'd her Iv'ry Arm;  
And, like *Pygmalion*, found the Statue warm.  
Small Arguments there needed to prevail,  
A Storm of Kisses pour'd as thick as Hail.  
Thus long in mutual Bliss they lay embrac'd,  
And their first Love continu'd to the last:  
One Sun-shine was their Liſe; no Cloud between;  
Nor ever was a kinder Couple seen.

And so may all our Lives like theirs be led;  
Heav'n send the Maids young Husbands, fresh in Bed:  
May Widows wed as often as they can,  
And ever for the better change their Man.  
And some devouring Plague pursue their Lives,  
Who will not well be govern'd by their Wives.

`[commentary extracted]`

'The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,' as filled out by Percy from the fragments in his manuscript, Reliques, 1765, III, 11, is translated by Bodmer, I, 110; by Bothe, p. 75; by Knortz, Lieder u. Romanzen Alt-Englands, p. 135.

1 KINGE ARTHUR liues in merry Carleile,  
And seemely is to see,  
And there he hath with him Queene Genever,  
*That* bride soe bright of blee.

2 And there he hath with [him] Queene Genever,  
*That* bride soe bright in bower,  
And all his barons about him stoode,  
*That* were both stiffe and stowre.

3 The *king* kept a royall Christmasse,  
Of mirth and great honor,  
And when ...  
...  

* * * * *

4 'And bring me word what thing it is  
That a woman [will] most desire;  
This shalbe thy ransome, Arthur,' he sayes,  
'For Ile haue noe other hier.'

5 *King* Arthur then held vp his hand,  
According thene as was the law;  
He tooke his leaue of the baron there,  
And homward can he draw.

6 And when he came to merry Carlile,  
To his chamber he is gone,  
And ther came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
As he did make his mone.

7 And there came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
*That* was a curteous knight;  
'Why sigh you soe sore, vnckle Arthur,' he said,  
'Or who hath done thee vnright?'

8 'O peace, O peace, thou gentle Gawaine,  
That faire may thee beffall!  
For if thou knew my sighing soe deepe,  
Thou wold not meruaUe att all.

9 'Ffor when I came to Tearne Wadling,  
A bold barron there I fand,  
With a great club vpon his backe,  
Standing stiffe and strong.

10 'And he asked me wether I wold fight  
Or from him I shold begone,  
O[r] else I must him a ransome pay,  
And soe depart him from.

11 'To fight wtth him I saw noe cause;
Methought it was not meet;  
For he was stiffe and strong with-all,  
His strokes were nothing sweete.

12 'Therefor this is my ransome, Gawaine,  
I ought to him to pay;  
I must come againe, as I am sworne,  
Upon the New Yeers day;

13 'And I must bring him word what thing it is
...  
...  
...

14 Then king Arthur drest him for to ryde,  
In one soe rich array,  
Toward the fore-said Tearne Wadling,  
That he might keepe his day.

15 And as he rode over a more,  
Hee see a lady where shee sate  
Betwixt an oke and a greene hollen;  
She was cladd in red Scarlett.

16 Then there as shold haue stood her mouth,  
Then there was sett her eye;  
The other was in her forhead fast,  
The way that she might see.

17 Her nose was crooked and turnd outward,  
Her mouth stood foule a-wry;  
A worse formed lady than shee was,  
Neuer man saw with, his eye.

18 To halch vpon him, *King* Arthur,  
This lady was full faine,  
But *King* Arthur had forgott his lesson,  
What he shold say againe.

19 'What knight art thou,' the lady sayd,  
'That will not speak to me?  
Of me be thou notliing dismayd,  
Tho I be ugly to see.

20 'For I haue halched you curteouslye,  
And you will not me againe;  
Yett I may happen Sir Knight,' shee said,  
'To ease thee of thy paine.'

21 'Giue thou ease me, lady,' he said,  
'Or helpe me any thing.  
Thou shalt have gentle Gawaine, my cozen,  
And marry him with a ring.'

22 'Why, if I help thee not, thou noble *King* Arthur,  
Of thy owne hearts desiringe, 
Of gentle Gawaine ...  
...

23 And when he came to the Tearne Wadling,  
The baron there cold he finde,  
With a great weapon on his backe,  
Standing stifEe and stronge.

24 And then he tooke *King* Arthurs letters in his hands,  
And away he cold them fling,  
And then he puld out a good browne sword,  
And cryd himselfe a king.

TO DO

25 And he sayd, I have thee and thy land, Arthur,  
To doe as it pleaseth me,  
For this is not thy ransome sure,  
Therfore yeeld thee to me.

26 And then bespoke him noble Arthur,  
And bad him hold his hand:  
'And giue me leaue to speake my mind  
In defence of all my land.'

27 He said, As I came over a more,  
I see a lady where shee sate  
Betweene an oke and a green hollen;  
Shee was clad in red Scarlett.

28 And she says a woman will haue her will,  
And this is all her cheef desire:  
Doe me right, as thou art a baron of sckill,  
This is thy ransome and all thy hyer.

29 He sayes, An early vengeance light on her!  
She walkes on yonder more;  
It was my sister that told thee this,  
And she is a misshappen hore.

30 But heer He make mine avow to God. 
To doe her an euill turne,  
For an euer I may thate fowle theefe get,  
In a fyer I will her burne.

31 Sir Lancelott and Sir Steven bold,  
They rode with them that day,  
And the formost of the company  
There rode the steward Kay.

32 Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,  
Sir Garrett with them soe gay,  
Soe did Sir Tristeram *that* gentle *knight*,  
To the forrest fresh and gay.

33 And when he came to the greene forrest,  
Underneath a greene holly tree,  
Their sate that lady in red scarlet  
*That* unseemly was to see.

34 Sir Kay beheld this ladys face,  
And looked vppon her swire;  
'Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he sayes,  
'Of his kisse he stands in feare.'

35 Sir Kay beheld the lady againe,  
And looked vpon her snout;  
'Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he saies,  
'Of his kisse he stands in doubt.'

36 'Peace, *cozen* Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
'Amend thee of thy life;  
For there is a knight amongst vs all  
*That* must marry her to his wife.'

37 'What! wedd her to wiffe!' then said Sir Kay,  
'In the diuells name anon!  
Gett me a wiffe where-ere I may,  
For I had rather be slaine!'

38 Then some tooke vp their hawkes in hast,  
And some tooke vp their hounds,  
And some sware they wold not marry her  
For citty nor for towne.

39 And then be-spake him noble *King* Arthur,  
And sware there by this day,  
'For a litle foule sight and misliking  
...

40 Then shee said, Choose thee, gentle Gawaine,  
Truth as I doe say,  
Wether thou wilt haue me in this liknesse  
In the night or else in the day.

41 And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Was one soe mild of moode,  
Sayes, Well I know what I wold say,  
God grant it may be good!

42 To haue thee fowle in the night  
When I with thee shold play —  
Yet I had rather, if I might,  
Haue thee fowle in the day.

43 'What! when lords goe with ther feires,' shee said,  
'Both to the ale and wine,  
Alas! then I must hyde my selfe,  
I must not goe withinne.'

44 And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Said, Lady, that's but skill;  
And because thou art my owne lady,  
Thou shalt haue all thy will.

45 Then she said, Blessed be thou, gentle Gawain,  
This day that I thee see,  
For as thou seest me att this time,  
From hencforth I wilbe.

46 My father was an old knight,  
And yett it chanced soe  
That he marryed a younge lady  
*That* brought me to this woe.

47 Shee witched me, being a faire young lady,  
To the greene forrest to dwell,  
And there I must walke in womans liknesse,  
Most like a feend of hell.

48 She witched my brother to a carlish b . . .  
...  
...  
...

49 ...  
...  
'That looked soe fouls, and that was wont  
On the wild more to goe.'

50 'Come kisse her, brother Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
'And amend thé of thy liffe;  
I sweare this is the same lady  
*That* I marryed to my wife.'

51 Sir Kay kissed that lady bright,  
Standing vpon his ffeete;
He swore, as he was trew knight,  
The spice was neuer soe sweete.

52 'Well, *cozen* Gawaine,' sayes Sir Kay,  
'Thy chance is fallen arright,  
For thou hast gotten one of the fairest maids  
I euer saw with my sight.'

63 'It is my fortune,' said Sir Gawaine;  
'For my vnckle Arthurs sake  
I am glad as grasse wold be of raine,  
Great ioy that I may take.'

54 Sir Gawaine tooke the lady by the one arme,  
Sir Kay tooke her by the tother,  
They led her straight to *King* Arthur,  
As they were brother and brother.

55 *King* Arthur welcomed them there all,  
And soe did Lady Geneuer his queene,  
With all the knights of the Round Table,  
Most seemly to be scene.

56 *King* Arthur beheld that lady faire  
That was soe faire and bright,  
He thanked Christ in Trinity  
For Sir Gawaine that gentle knight.

57 Soe did the knights, both more and lesse,  
Reioyced all that day  
For the good chance that hapened was  
To Sir Gawaine and his lady gay.

THE KNIGHT AND THE LOATHLY LADY:

VARIANTS AND ANALOGUES OF THE WIFE OF BATH'S TALE. BY W. A. CLOUSTON.

GOWER anticipated the Wife of Bath's characteristic Tale by a few years in his *Confessio Amantis*, but there seems no good reason to suppose Chaucer to have borrowed from his friend, the two versions differing so very considerably in details, and it is probable that both poets drew their materials independently from a French source, or sources. This is Gower's story, from the First Book of the *Confessio Amantis*, Harl. MS. 3869, beginning on leaf 34:

Gower's Tale of Florent.

THERE whas wylom be daies olde [leaf 34]  
A worj>i knyht, and as men tolde, He was Neuoeu1 to theinperour, piorent, nephew

, - , . ~ .-, . to the emperor,

And of his Court a Courteour. 4

He was a man J>at mochel myhte; a worthy and

brave knight,

Of armes he was desirous,

Chiualerous and amorous; 8

And, for J>e fame Of WOrldeS Speche, [fol. 346.] in quest of ad-

ventures,

Strange auentures for to seche,

* The marginal note, in red, is as follows: Hie contra amori inobedientes, ad co»tme»tdacio«em Obediencie Confessor super eod<??/t exempltim ponit, vbi dicit, q?i#d cum quidawz.

J Nephew.

TO DO

The chief points of difference between the foregoing and the Wife of Bath's Tale are as follows: In Gower a knight has slain the son and heir of a great lord, whose castle he afterwards happens to come to in the course of his adventures. They dare not openly put him to death, fearing his uncle, the emperor; but the slain man's grandmother induces him to sign a bond, by which he agrees to forfeit his life should he fail to give the answer to a certain question. In Chaucer a bachelor of the royal household is condemned to death for rape. The queen having interceded for him, the king leaves his life at her disposal, who tells him that he shall be pardoned if he answer the question, "What do women most desire?" In Gower the loathly lady who gives the knight the information of which he is in quest had been bewitched by her stepmother, and resumes her proper form when she is married to the knight; while in Chaucer she is a benevolent fairy, who assumed a hideous form to test the knight's fidelity to his word and save his life.

CHAPTER 6 — GAWAIN

...

The last poem of this group is _The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell_, originally 925 lines in length. `[A leaf is wanting in the unique MS.]` It is in the South Midland dialect of about 1450. As in so many of these poems it opens with a hunting expedition by Arthur. He parts company with the others to pursue a giant hart, and meets a knight named Sir Gromersomer Joure, who claims that his lands have been wrongfully given to Sir Gawain, and says that he will kill Arthur unless he finds out within a year what women most desire. Arthur has to promise to return, and sets about finding the required answer. He is given enough different replies to fill a large volume; but on the day before his appointment with Gromersomer Joure he meets a hideous hag who tells him that she alone knows the correct one, which she will give him on condition that she may wed Gawain. The King says that he will ask Gawain, who agrees without hesitation. The hag, by name Dame Ragnell, then informs Arthur that women most desire ‘to have the sovereignty'. She will only hold him to the bargain if this is the right answer. Having tried all the other replies, Arthur finally gives Gromersomer Joure that of the hag, which is indeed correct. Gawain has to wed her, to the sorrow of the court, even though he seems cheerful enough. At the wedding feast Ragnell disgusts everyone by eating as much as six men. They retire to bed, and Ragnell demands a kiss from her husband. It is given and she turns into a beautiful maiden, who says that she may be like this either by day or night, according to his choice. Gawain, in accordance with the answer she had given Arthur earlier, puts the matter in her hands, and as a result is told that she will always retain her new form.

This story, of the loathly bride who must win a handsome husband in order to be freed from a spell, is one of the commonest of folk-tales. An Irish version occurs in the twelfth-century Book of Ballynote; the present version may have been Scandinavian in origin, or have been influenced by Scandinavian tales, especially in the detail of the bride's grotesque appetite.

Other English tellings of it are to be found in Gower's Confessio Amantis, and in The Wife of Bath's Tale. The Chaucerian version is probably the best-known of the three, but has the least connections with Arthur. The introduction would appear to show that Chaucer knew the story on which The Gest of Sir Gawain was based; for the main story, he used, with free adaptations, an earlier version of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_. It is the rape of Brandelis's sister which is the central incident of The Gest of Sir Gawain that causes the question: ‘What do women most desire?' Gawain is fittingly punished by having to marry the hideous hag who provides the answer. The feast, obviously in Chaucer's original, is omitted, with the remark that there was no feasting on such a sad occasion. And the final choice is very different: Gawain's bride can either remain hideous and be faithful to her husband, or he can have her beautiful and take his chance. By giving her the choice, he gets her both beautiful and faithful.

Both this free version, and the rather closer one of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_ come from a common original in which Gawain was hero, since Chaucer is unlikely to have added an Arthurian background, and yet, because of the discrepancy in dates, cannot have used the present version of The Wedding. Malory must have known either this or its predecessor, for he mentions Sir Gromersomer Joure. `[Identical with Sir Grummor Grummorson.]`

There is little remarkable in the poem's style, which is very much inferior to _The Wife of Bath's Tale_, although less crude and grotesque than the other works of the ‘primitive' group. Had the Chaucerian version stronger associations with Arthurian literature, it would rank as second only to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. As it is, it hardly falls within our scope, having no more than a name or two and half a dozen lines of introduction to identify it with Arthur and his court.

> Arthur returns to Carlisle and tells Gawain about Sir Gromer's challenge. At Gawain's suggestion, the pair separates and rides through the country, collecting answers in a book. With a month to go, Arthur returns to Ingleswood and meets a monstrously ugly woman, Dame Ragnell. She promises to give Arthur the correct answer, on the condition that he marries her to Sir Gawain. Arthur reluctantly consults Gawain, who agrees because of his love for the king. Arthur returns to the forest once more, where Ragnell tells him that all women want ‘sovereignty'.
>
> When the year is up, Arthur returns to Sir Gromer and gives him his answer. The knight curses Ragnell, his sister, for helping the king, but has to admit that he is right. Ragnell returns to Carlisle with Arthur and insists on a lavish marriage in front of the whole court. Everyone marvels at her ugliness as she devours the splendid wedding banquet. [The couple retire] and Ragnell rebukes Gawain for his lack of sexual desire. He turns to find his wife transformed into a beautiful woman. She offers him a choice: she can be beautiful either at night or during the day. Gawain cannot decide, and tells his wife to make the decision. Delighted, she informs him that he has broken an enchantment placed on her by her stepmother: now that the best knight in England has given her sovereignty, she can be beautiful all the time. The couple go to bed.
>
> When Arthur checks on Gawain the next day, the knight shows him his beautiful wife. The king rejoices, and tells the court about Sir Gromer. Ragnell promises to obey Gawain in all things, and asks Arthur to be good to her brother; everyone agrees that she is the fairest lady at the court. She and Gawain have a son, Gyngolyn, and live in perfect harmony for five years until she dies. The poem concludes with a prayer that its author be released from prison.

> King Arthur spends Christmas at Carlisle with Guinevere and his barons. [While hunting near the Tarn Wathelane, he is accosted by a ferocious baron] who agrees to release him if he returns in a year's time with an answer to the question ‘what do women most desire?' Arthur returns to Carlisle and confides in Gawain, describing the strength and ferocity of the unknown knight. [Arthur and Gawain search for an answer to the question, collecting a sheaf of answers without success]. On the appointed day, Arthur sets out for the Tarn. On his way he meets a hideous crone, dressed in scarlet. She rebukes him for his discourteous greeting, but offers to help him. He eagerly agrees, offering her Gawain in marriage. [She gives him an answer] and he continues on his way. The baron rejects Arthur's sheaf of answers, claiming the king as his captive, until Arthur gives him the crone's reply: ‘a woman desires to have her will'. Vowing to be revenged against the crone, his sister, he admits that Arthur is right and releases him.
>
> [Arthur returns to court and gathers his knights] They all ride into the forest until they come to the crone. Kay scorns her ugliness, but Gawain cryptically remarks that one of them must marry her. Kay and the other knights refuse, [but Gawain agrees and they all return to court. After the wedding, Gawain and his bride retire to his chamber. She transforms into a beautiful young maiden] and offers him a choice: she can be beautiful during the day or during the night. When he chooses night, she reprimands him, reminding him of their public humiliation. He replies that he was simply testing her, and grants her ‘her will'. Delighted, she promises to be beautiful all the time, informing him that she and her brother were bewitched by their wicked stepmother. [They consummate the marriage, and when Kay comes to check on them in the morning, Gawain relates his wife's story]. Kay kisses the maiden, praising her beauty, and they all go to Arthur. The whole court welcomes them and they celebrate.

The Wife of Bath

A merry Wife of Bath comes next in place,  
But somewhat deaf, with an Autumnal Face.  
By Trade a Clothumaker, who ſcorn'd to grant,  
Her Work outdone at *Ipres*, or at *Gaunt*.  
No Matron could with greater Zeal incline,  
To pay her Offering at the *Martyr's Shrine*.  
She neither patient, nor devout could be,  
If any rival'd her in Charity.  
In her own Pariſh ſhe wou'd take the Wall,  
Before the proudeſt Matron of em all:  
Upon a *Sunday* ever trimly dreſt,  
She flaunted forth, the Envy of the reſt,  
Large were her Kerchiffs, yet more gorgeous made  
With her own Work, and full three Pounds they weigh'd.  
Scarlet her Hoſe, her gloſſy Shoes were new;  
Bold was her Face, and ruddy was its Hue.  
Not one of her five Husbands could be foundd,  
She laid 'em ſafely up in holy Ground,  
With theſe ſhe made a ſhift to paſs her Youth;  
Such was this good Wife's Conſtancy and Truth.  
She travell'd far, paſsd many a rapid Stream;  
Thrice ſaw the Reliques of *Jeruſalem*.  
*Rome* and the *Catacombs*, ſhe knew full well;  
Strange things of *Cologne* and its Kings cou'd tell:  
*Spain* ſhe had travell'd o'er from End to End,  
And good St. *James* was very much her Friend.  
Of various Haps and Perils by the Way,  
Much had ſhe known, and yet much more wou'd ſay.  
Upon an ambling Pad at caſe ſhe ſat,  
Gingling the Bitt, and ſlack'd her Pace to chat:  
A ſteeple Hat ſhe wore upon her Head,  
Whoſe ample Brims were like a Buckler ſpread:  
O'er her large Hips a Mantle fairly wrought;  
Before, her Kerchiff to a Point was brought:  
Like a rank Rider, pointed Spurs ſhe wore;  
Of *Jefts* ſhe had an unexhauſted Store.  
Her Talk did notably *Love's Art* advance,  
For ſhe had practis'd long that *Old, New Dance*.

PROLOGUE TO THE WIFE OF BATH'S TALE

By the Same Hand `[Mr. Pope]`

Behold `[The Wife of Bath speaks]` the Woes of Matrimonial Life,  
And hear with Rev'rence an experienc'd Wife!  
To dear—bought Wiſdom give the Credit due,  
And think, for once, a Woman tells you true.  
In all theſe Trials I have borne a Part.  
I was myſelf the Scourge that caus d the Smart:  
For, ſince Fifteen, in Triumph have I led  
Five captive Husbands from the Church to bed.

*Chriſt* ſaw a Wedding once, the Scripture ſays,  
And ſaw but one, tis thought, in all his Days:  
Whence ſome infer, whole Conſcience is too nice,  
No pious *Chriſtian* ought to marry twice.  
But let them read, and ſolve me, if they can,  
The Words addreſe'd to the *Samaritan*.  
Five times in lawful Wedlock ſhe was join'd;  
And ſure the certain Stint was ne'er defin'd.

*Increaſe and Multiply*, was Heav'n's Command,  
And that's a Text I clearly underſtand.  
This too, *Let Men their Sires and Mothers leave*,  
*And to their dearer Wives for ever cleave.*  
More Wives than one by *Solomon* were try'd,  
Or else the Wiſeſt of Mankind's bely'd  
I've had myſelf full many a merry, Fit;  
And truſt in Heav'n I may have many yet.  
For when my tranſitory Spouſe, unkind,  
Shall die and leave his Woeful Wife behind,  
I'll take the next good *Chriftian* I can find.  

*Paul*, knowing one could never ſerve out turn,  
Declar'd, 'twas better far to wed than burn.  
There's Danger in in aſſembling Fire and Tow;  
I grant 'em that; and what it means, you know.  
The ſame Apoſtle too has elſewhere own'd,  
No Precept for Virginity he ſound:  
Tis but a Counſel —  and we Women ſtill  
Take which we like, the Counſel, or our Will.

I envy not their Bliſs, if he or ſhe  
Think fit to live in perfect Chaſtity;  
Pure let them be, and free from Taint of Vice;  
I, for a few ſlight Spots, am not ſo nice.  
Heav'n calls us different Ways, on Theſe beſtowe  
One proper Gift, avother grants to Thoſe:  
Not ev'ry Man's oblig'd to ſell his Store,  
And give up all his Subſtance to the Poor;  
Such, as are perfect, may, I cant deny;  
But, by your Leave, Divines, ſo am not I.

Full many a Saint, fince firſt the World begany .  
Liv'd an unſpotted Maid, in ſpite of Man:  
Let ſuch (a God's Name) with fine Wheat be fed,  
And let us honeſt Wives eat Barley-bread.  
For me, I'll keep the Poſt aſſign'd by Heav'n,  
And uſe the copious Talent it has giv'n:  
Let my good Spouſe pay Tribute, do me Right,  
And keep an equal Reck'ning ev'ry Night,  
His proper Body is not his, but mine;  
For ſo ſaid *Paul* and *Paul*'s a ſound Divine.

Know then, of thoſe five Husbands I have had,  
Three were juſt tolerable, two were bad.  
The three were old, but rich and fond beſide,  
And toil'd moſt piteouſly to pleaſe their Bride:  
But fince their Wealth (the beſt they had) was mine,  
The reſt, without much Loſs, I could retign.  
Sure to be lov'd, I took no Pains to pleaſe,  
Yet had more Pleaſure far than they had Eaſe.

Preſents flow'd in apace: with Show'rs of Gold  
They made their Court, like *Jupiter* of old.  
If I but ſmil'd, a ſudden Youth they found,  
And a new Palſy ſeiz'd them when, I frown'd.

Ye ſov'reign Wives! give ear, and underſtand;  
Thus ſhall ye ſpeak. and exerciſe Command.  
For never was it giv'n to mortal Man,  
To lye ſo boldly as a Woman can.  
Forſwear the Fact, tho' ſeen with both his Eyes;  
And call her Maids to witneſs how he lyes.

'Hark, old Sir *Paul*! ( twas thus I us'd to say)  
'Whence is our Neighbour' s Wife ſo rich and gay?  
'Treat'd; careſs'd, where=e'erſhe's pleas'd to roam?  
'I ſit in Tatters, and immar'd at Home.  
'Why to her Houſe doſt thou ſo oft repair?  
'Art thou ſo am'rous? and is ſhe ſo fair?  
'If I but ſee a Couſin, ora a riend,  
'Lord! how you ſwell, and rage like any Fiend!  
'But you reel Home, a drunken beaſtly Bear,  
'Then preach till Midnight in your eaſy Chair,  
'Cry, Wives are falſe, and ev'ry Woman evil,  
'And give up all that's Female to the Devil.

'If poor, (you ſay) ſhe drains her Husband's Purſe;  
'If rich, ſhe keeps her Prieſt, or ſomething worſe;  
'If highly born, intolerably vain,  
'Vapours and Pride by turn poſſeſs her Brain;  
'Now gayly mad, now ſourly ſplenetick,  
'Freakiſh when well, and fretful when ſhe's fick,  
'If fair, then chaſte ſhe cannot long abide,  
'By preſſing Youth attack'd on every ſide.  
'If foul, her Wealth the luſty Lover lures,  
'Or elfe her Wit ſome Fool-gallant procures;  
'Or elſe ſhe dances with becoming Grace,  
'Or Shape excuſes the Defects of Face.  
There ſwims no Gooſe ſo grey, but, ſoon or late,  
She finds ſome honeſt Gander for her Mate.

'Horſes (thou ſay'ſt) and Aſſes, Men may try,  
'And ring ſuſpected Veſſels e're they buy:  
'But Wives, a random Choice, untry'd they take,  
'They dream in Courtſhip, but in Wedlock wake:  
'Then, nor till then, the Veil's remov'd away,  
'And al the Woman glares in open Day.

'You tell me, to preſerve your Wife's good Grace.  
'Your Eyes muſt always languiſh on my Face;  
'Your Tongue with conſtant Flatt'ries feed my Ear,  
'And tag each Sentence with, My Life! my Dear!  
'If, by ſtrange Chance, a modeſt Bluſh be rais'd,  
'B'e ſure my fine Complexion muſt be prais'd.  
'My Garments always muſt be new and gay,  
'And Fealts ſtill kept upon my Wedding Day.  
'Then muſt my Nurſe be pleas'd, and fav'rite Maid;  
'And endleſs Treats; and endleſs Viſits paid  
'To a long Train of Kindred, Friends, Allies;  
'All this thou ſayeſt, and all thou ſay'ſt are Lyes.

'On *Jenkin* too you caſt a ſquinting Exy:  
'What! can your Prentice raiſe your Jealouſy?  
'Freſh are his ruddy Cheeks, his Forehead fair,  
'And like the burniſh'd Gold his curling Hair.  
'But clear thy wrinkled Brow, and quit thy Sorrow,  
'I'd ſcorn your Prentice, ſhould you die to-morrow.

'Why are thy Cheſts all lock'd? on what Deſign  
'Are not thy worldly Goods and Treaſure mine?  
'Sir, I'm not Fool; nor ſhall you, by St. *John*,  
'Have Goods and Body to yourſelf alone;  
'One you ſhall quit, in ſpite of both your Eyes—  
'I heed not, I, the Bolts, the Locks, the. Spies.  
'If you had Wit, you d' ſay, Go where you will  
'Dear Spouſe; I credit not the Tales they tell:  
'Take all_ the Freedoms of a married. Life;  
'I know thee for a virtuous, faithful Wife.'

'Lord, when you have enough, what need you care  
'How merrily ſoever others fare?
'Tho? all the Day I give and take Delight,  
'Doubt not, ſufficient will be left at Night,  
''Tis but a juſt and rational Deſire,  
'To light a Taper at a Neighbour's Fire.

'There's Danger too, you think, in rich Array,  
'And none can long be modeſt that are gay;  
'The Cat, if you but ſinge her tabby Skin,  
'The Chimney keeps, and fits content within;  
'But once grown fleck, will from her Corner run  
'Sport with her Tail, and wanton in the Sun:  
'She licks her fair round Face, and frisks abroad,  
'To ſhow her Furr, and to be catterwaw'd.

Lo thus, my Friends, I wrought to my Deſires  
Theſe three right-ancient venerable Sires.  
I told em, Thus you ſay, and thus you do—  
And told 'em falſe; but *Jenkin* ſwore twas true.  
I, like a Dog, could bite as well as whine,  
And firſt complain'd, whene'er the Guilt was mine.  
I tax'd them oft with Wenching and Amours,  
When their weak Legs ſcarce dragg'd em out of Doors;  
And ſwore, the Rambles that I took by Night,  
Were all to ſpy what Damſels they bedight.  
That Colour brought me many Hours of Mirth;  
For all this Wit is giv'n us from our Birth,  
Heav'n gave to Woman the peculiar Grace  
To ſpin, to weep, and cully human Race.  
By this nice Conduct, and this prudent Courſe,  
By Murm'ring, Wheedling, Stratagem, and Force,  
1 ſtill prevail'd, and would be in the Right,  
Or Curtain-Lectures made a reſtleſs Night.  
If once my Husband's Arm was o'er my Side,  
What! ſo familiar with your Spouſe? I cry'd:  
I levy'd firſt a Tax upon his Need;  
Then let him ———— 'was a Nicety indeed!  
Let all Mankind this certain Maxim hold,  
Marry who will, our Sex is to be ſold.  
With empty Hands no Taſſels can you lure;  
But fulſome Love for Gain we can-endure;  
For Gold we love the Impotent and Old,  
And heave, and pant, and kifs, and cling for Gold,  
Yet with Embraces, Curſes oft I mixt;  
Then kiſs'd again, and chid and rail'd betwixt.  
Well, I may make my Will in Peace, and die;  
For not one Word in Man's Arrears am I.  
To drop a dear Diſpute I was unable,  
Ev'n tho' the Pope himſelf had ſat at Table.  
But when my Point was gain'd, then thus I ſpoke:  
'*Billy*, my Dear, how ſheepiſhly you look!  
'Approach, my Spouſe, and let me kiſs thy Cheek;  
'Thou ſhould'ſt be always thus, refign'd and meek!  
'Of *Job*'s great Patience ſince fo oft' you preach,  
'Well ſhould you practiſe, who ſo well can teach.  
''Tis difficult to do, I muſt allow;  
'But I, my Deareſt, will inſtruct you how,  
'Great is the Bleſſing of a prudent Wite,  
'Who puts a Period to domeſtic Strife.  
'One of us two muſt rule, and one obey;  
'And fince in Man right Reaſon bears the Sway,  
'Let that frail Thing, weak Woman, have her Way.  
'The Wives of all my Family have rul'd  
'Their tender Husbands, and their Paſſions cool'd.  
'Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to ſigh and groan;  
'What! would you have me to yourſelf alone?  
'Why, take me, Love! take all and ev'ry Part!  
'Here's your Revenge! you love it at your Heart.  
'Would I vouchſafe to ſell what Nature gave,  
'You little think what Cuſtom I could have.  
'But fee! I'm all your own — nay, hold — for ſhame!  
'What means my dear — indeed — you are to blame.'

Thus with my firſt three Lords I paſs'd my Life,  
A very Woman, and a very Wife.  
What Sums from theſe old Spouſes I could raiſe,  
Procur'd young Husbands in my riper Days.  
Tho' paſt my Bloom, not yet decay'd was I,  
Wanton and wild, and chatter'd like a Pye:  
In Country-Dances ſtill T'bore the Bell,  
And ſung as ſweet as Evening-*Philomel*.  
To clear my Quall-Pipe, and refreſh my Soul,  
Full oft I drain'd the ſpicy Nut-brown Bowl;  
Rich luſcious Wines, that youthful Blood improve,  
And warm the ſwelling Veins to Feats of Love:  
For 'tis as ſure, as Cold engenders Hail,  
A liqu'riſh Mouth muſt have a lech'rous Tail:  
Wine lets no Lover unrewarded go,  
As all true Gameſters by Experience know.

But oh, good Gods! whene'er a Thought I caſt  
On all the Joys of Youth and Beauty paſt,  
To find in Pleaſures I have had my Part,  
Still warms me to the bottom of my Heart.  
This wicked World was once my dear Delight;  
Now all my Conqueſts, all my Charms, good night!  
The Flour conſum'd, the beſt that now I can  
Is ev'n to make my Market of the Bran.

My fourth dear Spouſe was not exceeding true:  
He kept, twas thought, a private Miſs, or two:  
But all that Score I paid — as how? you'll ſay;  
Not with my Body, in a filthy Way:  
But I fo dreſs d, and danc'd, and drank, and din'd:  
And view'd a Friend, with Eye ſo very kind,  
As ſtung his Heart, and made his Marrow fry  
With burning Rage, and frantick Jealouſy.  
His Soul, I hope, enjoys eternal Glory;  
For here on Earth I washis Purgatory.  
Oft', when his Shoe the moſt ſeverely wrung,  
He put on careleſs: Airs, and fat and ſung.  
How ſore I gall'd him only Heav'n could know,  
And he that felt, and I that caus'd the Woe.  
He dy'd, when laſt from Pilgrimage I came,  
With other Goflips, from *Jeruſalem*;  
And now lies buried underneath a Rood,  
Fair to be ſeen, and rear'd of honeſt Wood.  
A Tomb, indeed, with fewer Sculptures grac'd,  
Than that *Mauſolus*' pious Widow plac'd;  
Or where inſhrind the great *Darius* lay;  
But Coſt on Graves is merely thrown away.  
The Pit fill'd up, with Turf we cover'd o'er;  
So, bleſs the good Man's Soul; I ſay no more.

THE WIFE OF BATH.

The original of this tale should probably be sought in some ancient metrical romance. At least, we know, that there exists a ballad connected with the Round Table romances, entitled "The Marrttge of Sir Oawain," which seems to have been taken not from Chaucer, but some more ancient and romantic legend. Gower also had seized upon this subject, and wrought it into the tale, entitled "Florent" which is the most pleasing in his dull *Confessio Amantis*. But what was a mere legendary tale of wonder in the rhyme of the minstrel, and a vehicle for trite morality in that of Gower, in the verse of Chaucer reminds us of the resurrection of a skeleton, reinvested by miracle with flesh, complexion, and powers of life and motion. Of all Chaucer's multifarious powers, none is more wonderful than the humour, with which he touched upon natural frailty, and the truth with which he describes the inward feelings of the human heart; at a time when all around were employed in composing romantic legends, in which the real character of their heroes was as effectually disguised by the stiffness of their manners, as their shapes by the sharp angles and unnatural projections of their plate armour.

Dryden, who probably did not like the story worse, that it contained a passing satire against priests and women, has bestowed considerable pains upon his version. It is, perhaps, not to be regretted, that he left the Prologue to Pope, who has drawn a veil over the coarse nakedness of Father Chaucer. The tale is characteristically placed by the original author, in the mouth of the buxom Wife of Bath, whose mode of governing her different husbands is so ludicroudy described in the Prologue.

LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS OF ENGLISH COUNTIES. HAMPSHIRE.—THE OLD AND RIGHT MEMORABLE

ROMANCE OF SIR BEVIS OF HAMPTOUN AND

THE FAIR JOSAYN. Beavtirut Southampton, ninety years ago a mere humble Hampshire town, with but a small flock of thirteen vessels, and only three of those bound to foreign ports, is now a commercial Dives, with a vast fleet of great ocean steamers, and a busy population that has risen since 1800 from seven thousand nine hundred and thirteen to some fifty-five thousand. In 1781 this young Hampshire giant was not even

one of the English towns that was liable to window tax, not having more than four hundred houses liable to that mischievous impost. It has now, however, a goodly array of more than seven thousand residences, with power and will enough to add to their number. In 1858 the annual exports of Southampton were computed as worth five millions of money, and the duties on the port trade alone, says Mr. Woodward, brought in one hundred and twenty thousand pounds to the customs. But after all, let us sweep away the musty past, kings and crowns, Cromwell's men and Rupert’s mad Cavaliers, to make room for the great, the imperishable legend that has struck root into the very stones of Southampton, and against which Time

himself whets his remorseless scythe in |

vain. Round the ale jug and round the wine bottle Sir Bevis, the mighty champion, has been talked of for centuries, and will be talked of, just as they talk for ever of Clive at Shrewsbury, and of Havelock at Charterhouse. Bevis of Hampton is, in fact, one of those indelible, indestructible, persistent fabulous heroes that the Hampshire world positively refuses to forget. Time has passed this legend by long ago as inerasable.

Even the very school-boys above and below Bar know that Bevis of Hampshire was the son of old Sir Guy of Southampton, by the Strand; and that he fought stoutly against those proud invaders the Normans, and “ whacked ” them at Cardiff. That he slew a dragon they do not forget, nor can the grisly giant Ascapard, whom Sir Bevis found such a precious “ piéce de résistance,” ever fall out of the city memory as long as his painted image

stands by the venerable Bar Gate. Nothing | perpetuates a legend more than a tra- |

ditional spot. There is then an end of all incredulity. Now is there not, close to

Southampton, Bevis Mount, formerly the |

property of the canons of St. Deny’s Priory, and afterwards the residence of that brave general, the Earl of Peterborough ? and is it not well known to every honest and intelligent Southampton person that Bevis and Ascapard used to play at quoits there with huge lumps of rock, and send them whizzing and splintering into Southampton Water? Were not, too, Bevis and his wife buried near calm Solent, and is not his sword Morglay (the sword of Death) still to be seen in Arundel Castle? Age of the electric telegraph, the Flying Scotchman, the wild

Irishman, and subterranean railways, is it possible that such an old fourteenthcentury story can still linger among civilized people? Nineteenth century, you are a conceited, stuck-up fellow. The story of Sir Bevis is not dead yet, and is likely long to enjoy a green old age.

Having thus fairly snubbed the nineteenth century, let us refresh ourselves with a brief suramary of the brave old Hampshire story, which Chaucer in his Sir Thomas calls affectionately a ‘“romaunce of price.” It will, we are sure, amuse our readers, not only from its quaintness and adventure, that made it read and sung for centuries by English and French minstrels in hut and in castle hall, but also for its valuable and curious allusions to the rough and homely customs of the fourteenth century that hardly come into ordinary historical reading. Whether Sir Bevis was a Saxon chieftain warring against Normans, as the Saxons believed, or a Norman warrior wrestling against infidels, though a question fought over for ages, is no concern to us now. But the habits of our fourteenth century ancestors are and will ever be subjects of cuguiry. It was all very well for Puritanical George Wither (shame on him for a Hampshire man!) to call Bevis of Hampshire “trumpery.” But the fine old romantic story, scenes from which adorned the tapestry of Henry V.’s chamber, and the walls of Henry VIII.’s palace at Richmond, is not to be lightly “‘pooh-poohed” in that manner, by any sour despiser of the pleasant ways of Giant Country and Fairy Land.

The old Hampshire story runs thus. Sir Guy, Earl of Southampton, father of Sir Bevis, our hero, married late in life a young and beautiful princess of Scotland, who proved unfaithful, and employed her lover, young Sir Murdour, brother of the Emperor of Germany, to ambuscade old Sir Hugh, and to send her his head as a pleasant little souvenir, which he did. Bevis, then aged seven, was sent to Saber, a paternal uncle, a good sort of individual, who at the unnatural mother’s order to murder the child, pretended to kill him, but really sent him out on the downs asa herdsman’s boy. Bevis bore these hard lines bravely, till one day, as he lay among the sheep, he heard minstrels’ songs and the sound of revelry arising from the old castle in the mist below. This was rather too much for the sensitive but Stalwart boy. The German minstrel’s

fiddle-string had touched a tender chord : away with sheep-hook, up with oak cudgel, off with wallet, and down like a wild deer he dashes to his dead father’s old castle door. The porter calls him names, and in vain tries to push him back; one stiff blow from the young rosy fist sends the porter sprawling, and in a moment more the boy has denounced his wicked mother, and knocked down Sir Murdour with a murderous blow of his oaken cudgel. In vain the cruel countesss urges her knights to seize the child ; they dislike dangerous blows in the teeth, and stand dumb with astonishment at so precocious an elf.

Bevis is scarcely home and cool from these affrays, before the wicked countess is announced, and frightened Saber kas only just time to jam the brave boy into a cupboard. The countess scolds and reproaches Saber, confutes his shuffling evasions, and demands her child. Bevis, no whit scared, instantly jumps out and confronts this Norman Clytemnestra, who at once orders her attendant knights to drag the wilful child to the port, and sell him as a slave to any captain preparing to sail for Heathennesse. No doubt troublesome lovers and refractory claimants were sometimes disposed of in this way, in those times.

After many ups and downs at sea, Bevis arrives at the court of Ermyn, king of an uncertain Saracen country. The queen is dead, but his daughter Josayn is beautiful, and wears gold shoes, and has cheeks that remind one of the effect of blood dropped on snow, and she falls rapidly in love with the young Christian slave, whose naive answers so please King Ermyn that he at once offers him the succession of the crown, and what was twice as good, the white hand of his most fair daughter, one condition only being added—that he shall renounce Christianity in the usual Saracenic manner. With great imprudence, and all the zeal of Exeter Hall, the lad refuses the offer, and makes disagreeable allusions to Mahommed’s personal character and descent. King Ermyn, however, being a good. easy-going sort of fellow, forgives this, and at once appoints young Bevis his chamberlain and standard bearer elect. He was now fifteen.

The old Adam, or rather old Guy, soon breaks out. One Christmas Day, as Bevis is out riding with sixty Saracenic knights, they began to ridicule him for neglecting

to reverence such a festival. Bevis, disliking the general tone of their remarks, and their ugly infidel faces all grinning at him at once, offers to joust and unhorse the whole company, one after the other, although he is not yet a knight. They then fall on him treacherously, like cowardly beggars as they were, and Bevis kills the whole kit, much to the indignation of King Ermyn, who at once begins to meditate most alarmingly on the painful subject of bow-strings and axe edges. But good Josayn obtains the boy’s pardon, and salves his wounds, and kisses him from eye to chin.

The next exploit of young Bevis to win his spurs is an attack on a wild boar, who has taken to human flesh. and is the scarecrow of all that part of Saracendon. Bevis, blowing his horn, sects out in search of this boar, and tracks him at last to his den by a trail of human bones. His hunting spear breaks, for the brute proves as tough as a marble rock, but eventually, as the boar begins to pant, Bevis craftily runs a sword down his vast throat, and gives him his quietus. But the danger does notend here. On his way back through the royal forest, with the boar’s head stuck on a stump of the spear, Bevis meets twelve jealous keepers in armour, who insist, in the meanest manner, in claiming the huge trophy. Bevis, disliking this sort of thing extremely, beats out the brains of nine of these impertinents, and on his return to King Ermyn is welcomed with open arms.

Hunting, love, and war, these were the three great topics of the Norman minstrel, so the next adventure of Bevis turns on hard knocks, and we presently find Bradmond, King of Damascus, sending in a bullying sort of way to signify his intention of instantly espousing the fair Josayn, and if refused, of laying waste Ermyn’s country with fire and sword. Ermyn, naturally put out at this, proceeds to call together his barons, and raises at a wave of his spear twenty thousand good men, and for Saracens tolerably true. At Josayn’s entreaties Bevis is at once knighted, he puts on his quilted acqueton, his glittering hawberk, and his shining helmet; and his fair lady presents him

with a good sword, whose name was |

Morglay. There was no better under the sun, Many a land that sword hath won.

And she also gives him a thorough good

horse that had been christened Arundel. |

One swing, and Bevis is in his war saddle; one smile from Josayn, one blast of the horn, and Bevis is lost round the left hand turning of the street.

The insolent and furious Bradmond, relying on his giant standard bearer, Radyson, laughs aloud when he discerns Ermyn’s rude army of only twenty thousand men.

The two armies skirmish at first coquettishly.

But when they broke their first array,

Grim and bloody was the fray, as you may pretty well guess. Bevis, after breaking his spear in Ensign Radyson’s diaphragm, follows up that performance by a series of surgical experiments with Morglay, which soon make him uni-

versally feared, and probably respected, and |

Bradmond quickly spurs homeward, laugh-

ing on the wrong side of the mouth, but |

carrying behind his saddle two captive knights. But, bless you! Bevis is after him like a telegraph, and, with one blow, knocks

him from his horse, and releas2s the two |

profusely grateful knights. Then, again turning his attention to Bully Bradmond,

he scares with a flash of Morglay, and only | releases him on condition of his swearing |

allegiance and fealty to King Ermyn.

On his return to court, Bevis becomes a lion of the first water (to use a perhaps almost too strong metaphor), and is embraced by the King. The adorable Josayn, disarming him with her own hands, arrays him in a most expensive robe, and, by her father’s express order, waits on the young conqueror at table. That evening Josayn, in rather a bold way, tells her love to Bevis, who informs her

plainly that he is no match for a king’s’ daughter; but that she should marry a |

prince or a sultan, for, as he very justly observes—

TI am a knight of a strange land,

I have no more than in | stand. Upon which Josayn, with an outburst of love, more natural than prudent, remarks

that she would rather have him, almost | entirely deprived of habiliments, than all |

the wealth in the land of Mahoun. Bevis

not replying, Josayn first falls down and |

weeps sorely, and then arises in a rage—

“Go from my chamber, go,” she cries, “thou were fitter to hedge or to make a dyke than be dubbed a knight” (a fourteenth-century lady, all over!) “ and sit with sunny, bright-haired maidens. Ont of my way, churl! and Mahoun send you ceaseless care and sorrow!”

“My damsel,” says Bevis, presently,
rather hurt at this outburst of Sevacenic |

temper in his angel— “ T am no churl, My father was both knight and earl.”

The affair, however, goes on from a slight tiff to a bad tiff; and then to temper: retort, abuse, and, at last, a storm. Sevis returns all his presents and retires to his bedroom; and the lady, with a scornful look, flings herself out of the room, but only, like a true woman, to | repent the moment she got shut up in her own room. She instantly sends her confidential chamberlain, Boniface, to Bevis to apologise for her bitter words. But Bevis is not easily moved to relent: he throws the messenger a huge bolster full of gold, but refused to see Josaynagain. His stern anger soon melts the female Saracenic heart. Weeping, she comes to her lover's door and prays for pity.

* Mercy,” she cried, “‘ my leman sweet,”’

And then she fell and ’gan to weep,

** Forgive me that I have missasl,

My false gods I will forsake,

And Christendom for thy love take.”’ Bevis turns, and gives her one look, then raises her, and clasps her in his arms. “On that covenant I will love thee, fair Josayn.” And so he did. Unfortunately, those two false-hearted knights he had rescued from Bradmond’s clutches lurk in the room, and see and hear all this, and go and tell the king at once, like mean, sneaking spies, as they were, that his daughter has forsaken Mahoun for Bevis’s sake.

The moment that news reaches him the

wife, Saber had retreated to the Isle of Wight, which he had defended for Bevis’s sake against all the cavalry, infantry, engineers, and bombardiers of the usurper. The palmer, in fact, has been sent with'a | general roving order to Heathennesse to find the lost heir and bring him back to England. Crafty Bevis, however, not dis| closing himself, pretends to be a friend of | himself, and sends Mr. Terry back to pro;mise his good friend Saber speedy |succour. Terry picks up the remains of the diabolical roast curlews, and they part: Bevis riding on unsuspiciously to | Damascus—of all places in the world—on |his business to King Bradmond. He

| finds the palace, a moated building, gilded all over, and approached by a bridge, | with sixty bells hung beneath to announce

|the approach of any traveller; and at | th

the bridge-end is a tower painted with ' gold and azure, and on it perches a golden | eagle, whose eyes are like darting jewels. Unfortunately, as Bevis draws near this | first-rate residence, he comes upon a crowd | of brown Saracens, preparing a sacrifice to their idol Mahoun. This is too much for the missionary spirit of Bevis of Southampton, who at once shoulders his way to | the idol, tears off its golden crown, | throws it in the mire, and reproaches the | heathen hounds. A thousand hands dart | out to seize him; but Bevis, drawing his | sword, remarkably soon divides a dozen | heathen throats. Bevis, however, has no sooner delivered |his credentials to King Bradmond, than | he is thrown down into a deep dungeon

base Saracenic mind of King Ermyn turns | tenanted only by two most unpleasant all to gall, and he at once resolves on the | dragons, but, with the stump of a staff, death of the presumptuous Christian | Bevis soon proves one too many for

Consequently, suspecting no- | braunt, the marriage witnesses being his thing of the plot against him, off goes | royal highness the King of Babylon and Bevis; and after three days’ travelling | his eminence the Soldan of Persia.

bite by an angel, grows gradually so weak that his two keepers one day make resolve to put an end to him, Bevis, however, like blind Samson, by a last exertion of strength, kills one murderer with his fist and another with a sword. But, the jailors dead, no bran is dropped down (what aa awful reminiscence of some Norman baron’s dungeon !) and Bevis can only crouch and pray for death. But, thanks be to Heaven,a miracle! The chain that fastens him to the rock suddenly snaps, he seizes the rope by which the jailors had descended, and he is free. Hearing laughter in the king’s stables, Bevis breaks open the door, kills a dozen of the frightened grooms who take him for a ghost, being so wan, and his hair trailing on the ground, arms himself from a heap of handy army saddles, mounts the best horse, and rides off with hot speed to the drawbridge.

“ Halloa, you lazy knave,” he shouts to the porter, his blood beginning to circulate again, “you sleep away in your kennel till you have let that Christian dog we had in hold escape; let down the portcullis, knave, as you value your head.

Down rattles the drawbridge, over clatters Sir Bevis, and away he gallops as fast as he can into the dark forest. He is scarcely gone, however, before, with a clatter of spears and shields and a flutter of flags and mantles, out clatter King Bradmond and all his knights, gallantly led by Sir Graundere on his unrivalled charger Trenchefys, who are soon up with the bold fugitive. One dig, straight at the heart, and down drops the fierce but unready leader, and quick upon the saddle of Trenchefys leaps Sir Bevis, and hey for merry Englelond.

Hotly pursued by King Bradmond and his army, Bevis, on reaching the sea, boldly _ in and swims to the opposite shore.

aturally fatigued by this exertion, Bevis, when the horse reaches dry land and shakes himself, shakes off, but eventually pulls himself together, and at last reaches a promising-looking castle on the wall of which stands a fair lady. For the love of Heaven Bevis beseeches her for a “ meal’s meat.” The lady replies that her husband is a giant and an infidel, and he had better try further on. Bevis answers that he is dying of hunger, and that dine there he will, either as a guest or by force. The giant, hearing a disturbance, comes to the door at this crisis, with an iron door-bar in his hand, and by no means in the best of tempers.

“Where did you steal that horse?” he roars to Sir Bevis; “that is m brother's, Sir Graundere.” ‘God wot,” says Bevis, “I won it in battle when I made Sir Graundere a deacon; and if you don’t take extremely good care I'll make you a priest before we part.”

Upon which cue for combat a combat begins, with the usual results. The giant’s first clumsy blow misses Bevis and kills Trenchefrys; thenhetransfixes theshoulder of Sir Bevis with a javelin, who retorts by slicing off his head. Bevis then rushes into the castle, shouting for dinner, and the fair lady tastes all the dishes before him, and stanches his wounds, and our gallant hero does dine at last.

On the dead giant’s best horse—for Bevis is a perfect Dick Turpin in the matter of horses—the knight now rides off to Jerusalem to confess his sins and receive absolution. Hearing on his return road of Josayn’s marriage, and more cut up than any of his giants had been, Bevis goes off to Mountbraunt castle disguised as a poor paimer. Arrived there he mingles with a crowd of pilgrims waiting for their daily dole. Josayn welcomes him as a pious mendicant, and enquires eagerly of him about Sir Bevis. The disguised man proclaims himself a friend of Bevis, sent into various countries to search for a good steed called Arundel. The queen at once leads him to the stable, and at the sound of Bevis’s voice the brave horse snaps seven chains, and runs to him. Sir Bevis throws himself into the saddle, and Josayn cries for joy, for she knows it is he, and they at once prepare for flight. The lovers are soon off and away, and hide in a cave in a forest, where Bevis kills two lions.

Soon after this tussle, the‘lovers both mounted on Arundel, are met by a mighty and strong giant, one Ascapard, thirty feet long, and wielding a young oak for a club. This son of Anak is soon converted by Bevis, who drubs him within an inch of his life, and then makes him his attendant page.

On the sea shore they find a dromond (merehant ship), and clearing it of obnoxious Saracens, Ascapard takes up Arundel and the two riders under his arm, puts them on board, and off go the happy couple and the giant “buttons” to Cologne, where Ascapard is christened. During the ceremony, in a tub made expressly, Ascapard is so nearly drowned that he leaps out, declaring that he is being “ too much christened.” At Cologne Bevis

Sooslays a dragon, being restored during the conflict by a holy well, into which the dragon flips him.

From his grace the Bishop of Cologne Sir Bevis now obtains the loan of one hundred knights to sail to Southampton and revenge hisfather. Sir Murdour is joined by the king of Scotland and a large army from Germany, and a battle royal ensues. Old Saber behaves well, and eventually Bevis fells his enemy, and makes him captive, and Ascapard takes the emperor of Germany and boils him to death in a great cauldron of pitch, turpentine, and hot lead. The wicked countess, after this, unwilling to survive, throws herself from a tower and is killed. The Southampton people, seeing Bevis is best man, rush out, of course, to welcome him, and the. Bishop of Cologne is presently sent for to wed the long parted lovers. ©

And all the castle rocked and rung With their mirth and with their song.

Unfortunately the writer of the romance of Bevis of Hampton, like many of our dramatic writers of the present day, does

|, not know where to stop, and naturall

landsin anticlimax. After hehas finished the story of this Hampshire Samson spiritedly enough, he unwisely launches forth again. King Edgar makes Bevis his Earl Marshal, but the son of Edgar, a vain young man, trying to steal Arundel, is killed by the indignant horse, and his father vows revenge. To escape his doom Bevis leaves England, with his wife and his nephew Mr. Terry. At this crisis the ungrateful giant and page boy, Ascapard, turns traitor, and offers King Inor to betray Josayn to him, if he has only the help of sixty Saracens. In a forest abroad Josayn is seized with the pains of childbirth, and in the absence of Bevis and Mr. Terry is delivered of two knave (male) children. At that moment Ascapard stalks upon the scene and carries off the helpless mother. On Bevis’s return he swoons with grief, but on recovery wrapsthe babes in the ermine mantle which Josayn had dropped, mounts faithful Arundel, and calmly pursues his journey. The children he leaves to the care of a forester and a fisherman, and they are duly christened “at the church stile.” And now old Saber turns up again in his green old age. He and his wife both dreaming that some great disaster had befallen Bevis, he and twelve of his best knights, armed as pilgrims, had taken the road to Mountbraunt. Overtaking the traitor Ascapard, Saber rescues Josayn,

kills the giant with a blow of his pikestaff, while his knights polish off the sixty Saracen hounds. Josayn then dyes her skin yellow and green, and accompanies Saber for near seven years in search of Sir Bevis, whom at last they discover.

But Bevis is soon in the saddle again. King Inor, extremely irritated at the loss of Josayn, has begun to burn and ravage her father’s country. The Southampton hero instantly raises an army to succour poor King Ermyn, and with Saber, his wife and children, rushes to his help. The king receives him with enthusiasm, and he and all his people, being forgiven by the hero, then embrace Christianity, and are all christened together.’ King Inor is soon taken prisoner by the resistless Bevis, and for his ransom pays the tidy little sum of sixty hundred pounds of gold, besides handing over four hundred silk beds, with gold quilts, four hundred gold cups, and four hundred “ masetyn” ditto. Ermyn on his death-bed crowns Guy, the son of Bevis, and Saber then starts for England, merry, merry England.

All is going on well now in Germany where King Guy reigns, when a rascal thief,, named Rabone, steals the faithful steed Arundel. Saber, ever ready, disguises as a pilgrim and goes to Mountbraunt in search of the brave animal, and meeting Rabone leaps up behind him and kills him with a single blow. Saber is pursued on his flight home by the whole Saracenic army; but Bevis comes to his rescue and lops down the Saracenic turbans in the good old style. Inor is then advised by a misjudging friend named Bradnor, King of Syria, to end this disagreeable and protracted affair, and in the name of Termagaunt to challenge Bevis to single combat. If Bevis won he is to have the kingdom of Ermony (Armenia forsooth) for his trouble. The single combat takes place in an island on a lake, and, as might be supposed, mistaken King Inor falls under the edge of the terrible Morglay. Inor’s troops are also slain to a man, and Bevis, wearing the stained war armour of his dead foe, takes Mountbraunt, where all Saracens who refuse to joyfully accept Christianity, the religion of peace, are at once religiously put to death.

And now it would seem that a peaceful and contented old ageawaits our Hampshire champion; but no, fate will not lethimalone. News comes that King Edgar has deprived Robert, Saber’s son, of all the castles Bevis had bestowed upon him, in order to enrich

his wicked favourite, Sir Bryant of Cornwall. Bevis instantly levies a formidable army, and embarks for England. And here the Norman minstrel’s geography rises into imagination. Bevis lands at the well-known Southampton, and marching on encamps at a place hot familiar to us in poetry, i.e. Putney. Here he leaves his troops, and taking with him only twelve knights repairs to King Edgar at Westminster, and falling on his knightly knees requests humbly the restoration of his estates.

Edgar is inclined to yield ; but that bad man, Sir Bryant, the king’s steward, persuades him that Bevis is a dangerous outlaw and deserves death. The king, convinced by his unjust steward, issues a proclamation at once to the citizens to shut their gates, barricade every street, and seize Sir Bevis alive or dead. Bevis, arming himself and men, at once sallies from his inn intending to cut his way out of the city. He very soon meets the rascally Sir Bryant at the head of two hundred soldiers, and the two at once join issue. Bevis, mad at the sight, uses

Morglay with tolerable effect, cleaving Sir Bryant to the saddle, and slaying all his

luckless two hundred followers; but in “‘Goose-lane,” a narrow place where he gets hemmed in, Bevis, well-a-day, loses his twelve faithful companions, but in the “chepe,” orthe market-place, where there is a fair stage, he gets on better, cuts off heads as if they were poppy tops, while Arundel kicks and bites, and clears the ring at the double quick, 2s we may say. In the meantime Josayn, hearing Bevis is dead, sends her sons to seek him, and off they rattle to Putney with a good four thousand men. Sir Guy, mounts on an Arab horse and takes the sword Aroundight, with which Launcelot de Lake slew the fiery dragon; while Sir Miles bestrides a horse as swift as a swallow.

The allied forces cross the Thames by night, unopposed, and setting fire to Ludgate, force their way into London in search for Bevis. They find him exhausted, but unhurt, though he has been fighting a whole dayanda night. There is Arundel, too, up to his fetlocks in blood, and surrounded by dead Londoners. It is just daybreak, and a citizen, wellarmed, has made Bevis bend to the saddlebow, when Sir Guy rushes down like a thunder-bolt to rescue his father, and gives the burgher such a blow that his sword cleaves through helm, hauberk,

saddle, and horse, and flashes fire from the pavement. Bevis and Arundel both cheer up at this, and come out stronger than ever, especially when Sir Miles also arrives, and victory turns at last to them. Having slain sixty thousand Londoners, Sir Bevis and his gallant sons retire to the Putney camp considerably exhilarated.

King Edgar, touched at this, makes peace, offers his only daughter to Miles, Bevis’s other son, and crowns him King of England. Sir Guy is established in Ermony; while Bevis and Josayn settle down comfortably at Mountbraunt. The moment Josayn dies, news comes that the faithful Arundel had dropped dead; and, a few moments afterwards, Bevis dies, too, as he stoops to kiss the pale lips of his dead wife. Sir Bevis and Josayn are buried under the high altar of a church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, erected by their grateful subjects to their memory; and there their relics continue to work miracles to this day. And thus, says the tired minstrel, laying down his harp, and taking up the wine-cup, smilingly—

Thus endeth Bevis of Hamptoun  
That was so noble a baroun.

And it, perhaps, was a pity, our readers will think, that the worthy creature had not ended sooner.

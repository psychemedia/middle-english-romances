# Preface

My "in" to Middle English Romance started with Simon Armitage's *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*, a pacy, compelling, and frequently very funny, modern translation of the original poem.

In December, 2023, I performed a set of "Winter Tales" at Babushka Books, Shanklin, which included *Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries* and *Gawain and the Green Knight*.

At the start of 2024, I began a collaboration with harpist Theresa Ellis, combining harp and story in way that brings an extra dimension to the telling. Now working together as *Stories'n'Harp*, we are also branching into *cante fable* style stories, with sung verses provided by Jenni Charity. Some of the mediaeval tales noted herein will hopefully form a staple part of our repertoire, if they do not already do so.

Many of the tales that will make up this collection started life as metrical poems originally written in Middle English. As well as the Middle English versions — which can actually be quite readable once you get into the swing of it! — I will also try to include "contemporary" (or at least, 19th century) English versions, as well as 19th century narrative versions.

These notes will also include working note versions of my own tellings as and when I get the opportunities to work they up and tell them.

If you would like to book me to tell any of these tales, or suggest other tales for the telling — as well as a booking to give me soemthing to aim for! — please get in touch.

# Preface

My "in" to Middle English Romance started with Simon Armitage's *Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight*, a pacy, compelling, and frequently very funny, modern translation of the original poem.

In the notes collected herein, I try to find 19th century narrative versions, as well as metrical versions in Middle English and contemporary (or at least, 19th century) English.

These notes will also include working note versions of my own tellings as and when I get the opportunities to work they up and tell them.

If you would like to book me to tell any of these tales, or suggest other tales for the telling — as well as a booking to give me soemthing to aim for! — please get in touch.

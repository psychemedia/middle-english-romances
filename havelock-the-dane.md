# Havelock the Dane

A tale with a forked start, two independent, yet complementary, strands that come together at the end. The story can start either in England, or in Denmark. There are also opportunities for diffferently slicing and interweaving the English and Danish parts at the start of the tale. The story is also, in part, an onomastic tale, telling of how Grimsby came to be named.

Havelok the Dane

HEARKEN to me, good men, wives, and maidens ; I will tell you a tale of Havelok, a wight full hardy, ready at need, the stoutest warrior that ever rode a horse.

In former days there was a King of England called Athelwold ; the very flower of England was he, and he ruled justly and well. All things in his realm he ordered strictly, and maintained truth and right throughout the land. Under his rule robbers and traitors were put down ; men bought and sold freely, without fear, and wrongdoers were so hard pressed that they could but lurk and creep in secret corners. Athelwold set up justice in his kingdom. There was mercy for the fatherless in his day; his judgments could not be turned aside by bribes of silver and gold. If any man did evil, the King's arm reached him, to punish him, were he never so wary and strong.

This Athelwold had no heir, save only one daughter, very fair to look upon, named Goldborough. But ere she grew up, when as yet she could neither walk on her feet nor speak, the King fell ill of a dire sickness. He knew well that his time was come, and that death was nigh him. " What shall I do now ? " he said in his heart. " I know full well my hour of judgment is upon me. How shall my daughter fare when I am dead ? My heart is troubled for her : I think nought of myself. She cannot yet speak or walk : if she were of age to ride, she could rule England, and I would care nought about dying."

But it was idle to lament. The King was sure in his mind that he must die, and he sent messengers to all his vassals, to his earls, and his barons, rich and ^oor, from Roxburgh to Dover, bidding them come to him speedily where he lay sick.

All those who heard his message were sad at the tidings, and prayed that he might be delivered from death. They came with all speed to the King at Winchester.

" Welcome," said he, when they entered the hall of his dwelling. "Full glad am I that you are come, though gladness helps little now, when I am nigh the point of death. You see in what sorry case I lie. I have bidden you here that you may know that my daughter shall be your lady when I, your lord, am dead. But she is yet a child, and I am fain to make some true man her guardian till she be a woman grown : I will that Godrich, Earl of Cornwall, do guard her and bring her up. He is a true man, wise in counsel and wise in deed, and men have him in awe."

They brought a holy book to the King. On it he made Earl Godrich swear a solemn oath to keep Goldborough well and truly, till she was of age to rule and to order the realm of England wisely.

`[A key point is omitted here - that she should bemarried "to the highest, the best, fairest, and strongest man alive"]`

Then the little maid was given to the Earl, her new guardian. Athelwold thanked the Earl, and bade him be true to his charge ; and in a little while death took the good King.

When King Athelwold was dead, and the long lamentation for him ended, Godrich ruled England. In every castle he set some knight of his own, whom he could trust : all the English folk he caused to take an oath to be faithful to him ; and in a little while Athelwold's realm was altogether in his power.

In the meantime Goldborough was kept at Winchester, and brought up as befitted a King's daughter. Every day she seemed to grow in wisdom and fairness, till when she was twenty years old there was none like her in the land. But Godrich, when he saw how good and how fair she was, grew jealous of her. " Shall she be Queen ovei me ? " he thought. " Must I give up my kingdom and my power to her ? She has waxed all too proud ; I have treated her with too great gentleness. She shall not be Queen. I will rule, and after me my son shall be King."

As that treason crept into his mind, he forgot his oath to Athelwold, caring not a straw for it. Without more ado he sent for Goldborough from Winchester, and took her to Dover. There he set her in a strong castle, and clad her meanly, and guarded her so strictly that no man could see her or come at her without his leave.

Now it chanced that about this time the same thing came to pass in Denmark as in England. Birkabeyn, King of Denmark, died, and at his death gave to one Earl Godard the charge of his kingdom and of his son Havelok and his two daughters, Swanborough and Elfled. Godard stood by his oath no better than Godrich, but cast all three children into prison, and well nigh starved them to death. But when they had lain in prison for a little time, and were nearly dead of hunger, he went to see them.

"How do you fare?" he asked, for Havelok ran to him, and crept upon his knees when he sat down, and looked up joyfully into his face. " I hear that you moan and cry : why is this ? "

"We hunger sore," answered Havelok. "We have nought to eat, and no man has brought us meat or drink. We are nigh dead of hunger."

Godard heard his words, but felt no pity ; he cared not a straw for their misery. He took Swanborough and Elfled by the hand, and slew them then and there. Thereafter he turned to Havelok and would have slain him also. But the boy in terror cried for mercy. " Have pity," he said. " Spare me and I will give you all Denmark, and will vow never to take up arms against you. Let me live, and I will flee from Denmark this very day, and never more come back ; I will take oath that Birkabeyn was not my father."

At that some touch of doubt came into Godard's mind. He put up his knife, and looked at Havelok.

" If I let hi:n go alive," he thought, " he might work me much woe. He shall die, but not now. I will cast him in the sea and drown him."

He went thence, and sent for a fisherman named Grim.

" Grim," he said, " you are my thrall ; do my will and to-morrow I will give you your freedom. Take the boy Havelok, and at night lead him to the sea and cast him therein."

Grim took the boy, and bound him with strong cords, and bore him on his back to his cottage, and showed him to his wife Leve. " You see this boy, wife," said he. "I am to drown him in the sea; when I have done it, I shall be made a free man, and much gold will be ours ; so has our Lord Godard promised."

When Dame Leve heard that, she started up, and threw Havelok down so roughly that he hurt his head on a great stone that lay on the ground.

" Alas that ever I was a King's son," he moaned in his pain ; and he lay there where he fell till night-time.

When night fell Grim made ready for his task. " Rise up, wife, blow the fire," said he. " Light a candle. I must keep my word to my lord."

Leve rose to tend the fire. Her eyes fell on Havelok, who still lay on the ground. Round him, she marvelled to see, shone a bright light, and out of his mouth pro- ceeded light as it were a sunbeam.

" What is that light ? " quoth Dame Leve. " Rise up, Grim, look what it means ; what is this light ? "

Grim went to Havelok, and unbound him. He rolled back the shirt from the boy's shoulder. There he saw, bright and clear, a King's birth-mark.

"Heaven help us," said Grim, "this is the heir to Denmark, who should be King and lord of us all. He will work Godard great harm." Then he fell on his knees before Havelok. "Lord King," he said, "have mercy on me and on Leve here. We are both yours, lord, both your servants. We will keep you and nur- ture you till you can ride and bear the shield and spear ; Godard shall know nought of it. Some day I will take my freedom at your hands, not at his."

Then was Havelok blithe and glad. He sat up and asked for bread. "I am well-nigh dead," he said, "with hunger and hardship."

They fed him and cared for him, and lastly put him to bed ; and he slept soundly.

On the morrow Grim went to the traitor Godard. " I have done your will on the boy, lord," he said. " He is drowned in the sea. Now I pray you give me gold for a reward, and grant me my freedom, as you vowed."

Godard looked at him, fierce and cruel of mien. " Will you not rather be made an earl, proud knave ? " he asked. " Go home, fool ; go, and be evermore a thrall and churl, as you have ever been ; no other reward shall be yours. For very little I would lead you to the gallows for your wicked deed."

Grim went away. "What shall I do?" he thought as he hurried home. " He will assuredly hang me on the gallows-tree. It were better to flee out of the land altogether."

He came home, and told Leve aft ; and they took counsel together. Soon Grim sold all his wool, and his corn, and his cattle, his horses and swine, his geese and hens. Only his boat he kept ; and that he made ready for a voyage, with a good mast, strong cables, stout oars, and a new sail, till there was not so much as a nail wanting to make it better. Then he took on board his wife and his three sons, Robert the Red, William Wendat, and Hugh Raven, and his two fair daughters, Gunnild and Levive, and Havelok ; and they set sail.

The wind blew fair behind them, and drove them out to sea. Long did they sail, and came at last to England, to Lindsey at the mouth of the Humber.

They landed safely ; and before long Grim began to make a little house of clay and turf for them to dwell in. He named the place after himself, Grimsby; and so men call it now, and shall call it for ever, from now even to doomsday.

Grim was a skilful fisherman, and caught many good fish. Great baskets did he make, and others his sons made ; and they carried the fish inland in these baskets, and sold them. All over the country did Grim go with his fish, and came home always with store of bread, or corn, or beans, against their need. Much he sold in the fair town of Lincoln, and counted many a coin after his sales there.

Thus Grim fared for many winters; and Havelok worked with the rest, thinking it no shame to toil like any thrall, though he was a King's son born.

There came at last a year of great dearth. Corn was so scarce that all men were in great poverty, and Grim did not know how to feed all his family. For Havelok he had great dread, for he was strong and lusty, and would eat more than he could earn. And soon the fish in the sea also began to fail them, so that they were in sore straits. But Grim cared more for Havelok than for all his own family ; all his thoughts ran on Havelok.

"Dear son Havelok," he said at last, "I trow we shall die of hunger anon ; all our food is gone. It is better for you to go hence, and strive for yourself only, and not try to help us here. You are stout and strong ; go to Lincoln ; there is many a man of sub- stance there, who might take you in service. It were better for you to serve there than to see us starve here and to starve along with us. Would that I could clothe you fitly ! Alas, I am too poor. Yet for your sake I will cut up the sail of my boat, and make you a cloak of it to cover your rags."

He took the sail from his boat, and cut it up rudely into a cloak for Havelok. Then Havelok bade him God-speed, and set out. Hose and shoon had he none ; on his bare feet he walked, and came in time to the city of Lincoln.

He had no friend in Lincoln, and knew no man. For two days he went to and fro, fasting ; no man had work or food for him. But on the third day he heard a cry, "Porters, porters, hither quickly!" He sprang forward like a spark from coal, and thrust aside all who stood in his path ; sixteen stout lads did he knock down, and came to where fish was being laden into carts for Earl Godrich of Cornwall. There stood the Earl's cook, calling for men to lead the carts ; and Havelok fell to work with a will at his bidding. Many a great fish did he lift and carry — lampreys, eels, broad plaice, and all manner of kinds.

When all was done, " Will you take service with me ? " said the cook to Havelok. "I will pay you good hire and feed you well."

"Give me enough to eat, good sir," answered Havelok, "and I care not what you pay me. I will blow your fire, and fetch wood and water ; I can wash dishes, and cleave faggots, and clean eels, and do all that you need."

"You shall be my man," answered the cook.

So Havelok took service in Earl Godrich's house- hold, and drew water and cut wood, and did household tasks. Strong and large was he of body, and God had made him very fair to look on.

Earl Godrich was lord of all England; it lay as it were in his hand. Many men were wont to come to him at Lincoln for advice and to talk of great things ; and they held a parliament there, and came thither with a great train of men-at-arms and followers, so that the town was always full of folk coming and going.

It chanced one day that eight or ten young men began to play together near where Havelok was at work; they fell to putting a great stone, huge and heavy. He must needs be a stout man who could so much as lift it to his knee. But those who put it now were champions, and could cast it many a foot.

Havelok looked on and longed to put against them , and his master, seeing his looks, bade him go and try what he could do. He took the stone and poised it well ; and at the first effort he put it twelve feet or more farther than any other man.

"We have been here too long," said the rest. "This lad is mightier than any of us; it is time for us to go hence."

They went away, and spread the news that there was at Lincoln a lad mightier than any man of that day ; and Havelok's fame grew and was known far and wide. It came at last to Earl Godrich's ears.

"This is a stout knave," thought the Earl, when he- heard of Havelok's strength. " I would that he were wedded to Goldborough : he is the fairest and strongest man in England, and if I gave Goldborough to him, I should keep my word to Athelwold in some sort, for there is none like Havelok : no better man could she desire. And if she were wedded to him, she would be out of my way, and I should be secure in my rule, and my son should reign in England after me."

Thus he thought and planned secretly. Anon he- sent for Goldborough, and brought her to Lincoln. At her coming he caused bells to be rung, and there was great rejoicing ; but he was nevertheless full of cralt.

" You shall have the fairest man alive for hus- band/' he said to Goldborough : " therefore have 1 sent for you."

44 1 will wed no man but a King or a King's son, be he never so fair," she answered boldly.

" Would you gainsay me as if you were Queen and lady over me?" cried Godrich in great wrath. "You shall have a churl for husband, and no other. My cook's knave shall wed you ; he shall be your lord. To-morrow shall you be wedded to him."

Goldborough wept and prayed his mercy, but it was of no avail. On the morrow the church-bell was rung, and Godrich sent for Havelok. " Master, are you minded to marry ? " he asked.

"Nay, by my life," quoth Havelok. "What should I do with a wife ? I cannot feed her or clothe her ; I have no house and no possessions. The very clothes I \vear are the cook's, and I am his servant."

" If you do not take to wife her whom I will give you," said Godrich, " I will hang you high aloft, or thrust out your eyes."

At that Havelok was sore afraid, and granted all that Godrich bade. Then Godrich sent for Goldborough.

"You will take this man for husband," he said, "or you go to the gallows, unless rather I burn you at the stake."

She was adread at his threats, and durst not refuse, though she liked it ill. So they two were wedded perforce, and neither took joy in it.

When they were married, Havelok knew not what to do. He had no home whereto he might take Goldborough. Godrich had such hatred for Athel- wold's daughter that he would do nought to aid them ; and Havelok was in sore straits till he be- thought him of Grimsby.

Straightway he took Goldborough to Grimsby. But Grim himself was dead. Nevertheless his sons welcomed Havelok gladly, and took great joy in his return.

"Welcome, dear lord, and welcome to your fair lady," they said. " We have here horses and nets and ships, gold and silver, and much else that Grim our father bequeathed. But he bade us give them to you ; take them, dear lord ; they are all yours. You shall be our lord, and we will be your servants in all things."

So Havelok came back to Grimsby. But on the night of his coming Goldborough was sad and sorrow- ful as she lay beside him, and she could not sleep. Her wakeful eyes fell on Havelok, and she was aware suddenly of a wondrous sight. A bright light, clear and flaming, issued from his mouth, and lit up all the chamber.

"What may this mean?" she said to herself in sore dread. " Does it show me that some high fortune shall come upon Havelok ? "

She looked again, and saw a new wonder. On Havelok's shoulder a King's mark shone, a noble cross of red gold ; and as she looked, an angel's voice spoke to her: "Goldborough, let your sorrow be; Havelok, your husband, is a King's son and a King's heir. The golden cross signifies that he shall possess all Denmark and England, and shall be King, strong and stark, of both realms. This shall you see with your own eyes, and shall be his Queen and lady."

When she heard the angel's voice Goldborough could not contain her joy, but turned and kissed Havelok as he slept. Havelok had not heard the angel, but he started out of his sleep at Goldborough's kiss.

"Dear lady, are you awake?" he said. "A strange dream have I just dreamed. I thought I was in Den- mark, on the highest hill that ever I came to; it was so high that I could see, it seemed, all the world spread out. As I sat there, I began to possess Denmark, with all its towns and strong castles ; and my arms were so long that I surrounded in one grasp all Denmark, and drew it towards me till every man therein cleaved to me, and the strong castles began to fall on their knees, and the keys of them were at my feet. Another dream I dreamed also, that I flew over the salt sea to England, and with me went all the folk of Denmark. When 1 came to England, I took it all into my hand, and, Goldborough, I gave it to you. Dear wife, what may this be ? "

" May these dreams turn to joy, Havelok, as I deem they will," answered Goldborough. " I say to you that there is no strong king or emperor who shall be your peer, for you shall wear the crown of England in time to come, and Denmark shall kneel at your feet. Within a year this shall come to pass. Let us two go to Den- mark speedily ; and do you pray Grim's sons that they go with you, all three."

On the morrow Havelok went to church and be- sought aid of God. Then he betook himself to Grim's three sons, Robert, and William, and Hugh.

"Listen now to me," he said, "and I will tell you a thing concerning myself. My father was King of the Danish land, and I should have been his heir ; but a wicked wight seized the kingdom when my father died, and slew my two sisters, and gave me to Grim to drown ; but Grim spared me, and brought me hither as you know. Now I am come to an age when I can wield weapons and deal stout blows ; and never will I take comfort till I see Denmark again. I pray you come thither with me ; I will reward you well, and will give each of you ten castles, with the land and towns and woods that belong thereto." `[A small part of the original poem is here missing. I have ventured to follow Prof. Skeat in supplying what is clearly, in substance, the sequence of events. The original begins again, roughly, at "Havelok gave Ubbe a gold ring."]`

"We will follow you whithersoever you bid us, Havelok," they answered, "and we will, if it please God, win back your kingdom for you."

Havelok gave them due thanks, and began straightway to prepare all things for his going to Denmark. Soon he had made ready, and they set sail. Their voyage prospered, and they landed safely in Denmark, in the dominions of one Ubbe, a rich earl, who had been a friend of King Birkabeyn, Havelok's father.

When Havelok heard who was lord of that part of Denmark, he was glad, and set out to go to Ubbe's castle in good hope. He durst not say yet that he was Birkabeyn's son, for if Earl Godard heard of it, he would come against him and slay him before he could win any followers. But he went to Ubbe and spoke him fair and courteously, and gave him a gold ring, and asked leave to settle in that land to be a merchant ; and Ubbe seeing how strong and comely Havelok was, gladly gave him leave, and thereafter bade him to a great feast. Havelok went to the feast, and Goldborough with him, and Grim's sons also ; and Ubbe grew to love him so well that when the feast was ended, he sent him with ten knights and sixty men-at-arms to the magistrate of those parts, Bernard Brun, a man of might and substance, to whom Ubbe wrote a letter, saying that Havelok was to be treated courteously in all things.

Bernard was a trusty man, and entertained Havelok and Goldborough and all their company in seemly wise. But as they sat at meat, there came tidings that a band of sixty thieves, well armed and fierce, was at the gate, demanding entrance.

At that news Bernard started up and took a good axe in his hand, and went to the gate ; and Havelok followed him.

"What do you hera. rascals?" cried Bernard. "If I open the door to you, some of you will rue it. Those whom I slay not shall be put in fetters and cast into prison ! "

"What say you?" answered one of the thieves. " Think you that we are adread of you ? We shall enter by this gate for all that you can do."

Thereupon he seized a great boulder, and cast it mightily against the gate, and broke it.

Havelok saw what befell, and went to the gate. He drew therefrom the great cross-bar, and threw the gate wide open.

"I abide here," he cried. "Flee, you dogs."

"Nay," quoth one, "you shall pay for waiting;" and he came running at Havelok, and the two others close behind with him. But Havelok lifted up the door-beam, and at one blow slew all three. Then he turned upon others, and in a moment overthrew four more. But a host of them beset him with swords, and all his skill could not prevent them from wound- ing him : full twenty wounds had he, from crown to toe. But the smart of them drove him into a rage, and he began so to mow with the beam that the robbers soon felt how hard he could smite. There was none who could escape him, and whosoever he struck he slew ; and in a little while he had felled twenty of them.

Then began a great din to arise, for the rest of the thieves set upon Havelok and Bernard with all their might. But Hugh and his brothers heard the noise, and came running with many other men ; and before long there was not one of the thieves left alive.

On the morrow tidings came to Ubbe that Havelok had slain with a club more than a score of stout rogues. "What is this?" thought the earl. "I had best go myself and see the rights of the matter."

He went down to Bernard and asked him what had come to pass ; and Bernard, sore wounded from the fight, showed him his wounds, and told him how sixty robbers had attacked his house, and how Havelok had slain great plenty of them ; but Havelok also, he said, was grievously wounded in many places.

Others also of Bernard's men told the like true tale ; and Ubbe sent for Havelok, and when he had seen his wounds, called for a skilful leech, and took Havelok into his house and cared for him.

The first night that Havelok lay in Ubbe's house, Ubbe slept nigh him in a great chamber, with places boarded off for each man. About midnight he awoke, and saw a great light in the place where Havelok lay, as bright as if it were day.

" What may this be ? " he thought. " I will go myself and see. Perchance Havelok secretly holds revel with his friends, and has lit many lights. I vow he shall do no such sottishness in my castle."

He stood up, and peeped in between the boards that shut Havelok from him. He saw him sleeping fast, as still as any stone ; and he was aware of a great light coming as it were from Havelok's mouth.

He was aghast at that sight, and called secretly to his knights and sergeants and men-at-arms, more than five score of them, and bade them come and see the strange light; and the light continued to issue from Havelok's mouth, and to grow in strength, till it was like a sunbeam, and as bright as two hundred wax- candles.

Havelok's right shoulder was towards Ubbe and his men. Suddenly, as they looked at the light, they were aware also of a King's mark on the shoulder, a bright cross, brighter than gold, sparkling like a good car- buncle stone.

Then Ubbe knew that Havelok was a King's son, and he guessed that he must be Birkabeyn's son, the rightful King of all Denmark; "Never was any man so like his brother," he said, "as this Havelok is to Birkabeyn ; he is Birkabeyn's own heir."

And when Havelok awoke, he fell at his feet and did obeisance, he and all his men. "Dear lord," he said, " I know you to be Birkabeyn's son. You shall be King of Denmark; right soon shall every lord and baron come and do you homage."

Then was Havelok glad and blithe, and gave thanks to God for His goodness.

Before long Ubbe dubbed Havelok knight ; and as soon as he was knighted all the barons and lords of those parts came to him and swore fealty ; and anon they crowned him King of Denmark, and set them- selves in array to attack the false Earl Godard. But Godard's knights, being weary of his rule, had all gone over to Havelok ; and Grim's son Robert suf- ficed to meet him in combat. Robert wounded him in the right arm, and they bound him and brought him before Havelok.

Sorry now was Godard's lot ; all his greatness was gone from him, and he was abased ; even as the pro- verb says, "old sin makes new shame." He came before Havelok and his nobles, and they gave sen- tence upon him, that he should be flayed alive, and then hanged. And so he came to his end in great misery and torment.

When Godrich in England heard that Havelok was King of all Denmark, and purposed (for Havelok had given out that this was his intent) to come to Eng- land and set Goldborough on her throne, he was full rueful and sorry.

" If I let them land and overcome me," he thought, " I shall lose my power."

Thereat he set to work to gather a great host to meet Havelok when he should come ; and he spread lying tales to make the English hate and fear Havelok, saying that he would burn and destroy, and oppress them ; and by these means he got together many men and led them to Grimsby.

Anon came Havelok and his men, and landed at Grimsby; and they fought a great battle. Ubbe was the first to meet Godrich, and dealt him many a stout blow, but could not prevail over him; long they struggled; and at last Godrich wounded Ubbe sorely in the side, so that he fell, and his men bare him out of the fray. All that day Havelok's men fought with Godrich's men ; and on the morrow they fought again, and Godrich came face to face with Havelok himself.

"Godrich," Havelok cried, "you have taken Athelwold's kingdom for yourself; I claim it for his daughter Goldborough. Yield it up, and I will forgive you, for you are a doughty knight."

" Never will I yield," answered Godrich : " I will slay you here, and put out your eyes that now look on me, if you do not ilee right speedily."

He gripped his sword, and smote at Havelok, and clove his shield in twain. But Havelok drew his own good sword, and with one blow felled him to the earth. Yet Godrich started up again, and dealt him such a stroke on the shoulder that his armour was broken, and the blade bit into the flesh. Then Have- lok heaved up his sword in turn, and struck fiercely, and shore off Godrich's hand, so that he could smite no more, but yielded as best he might.

They seized Godrich and fettered him; and all the English took the oath of fealty to Goldborough, and swore to be her men. Then they passed judgment on Godrich, and sentenced him to be burnt to death. So Havelok and Goldborough came again into their kingdoms ; and Havelok rewarded Grim's sons and made them barons. Of Grim's daughters, Bernard married one, and was made Earl of Cornwall in place of Godrich ; and the other was wedded to the Earl of Chester. Havelok was crowned King of England as well as of Denmark ; and full sixty winters did he reign with Goldborough in great joy and prosperity.

CHAPTER V ; HAVELOK THE DANE 

The Origin of the Story 

The Danish occupation of England has left a very strong mark on our country in various ways — on its place-names, its racial characteristics, its language, its literature, and, in part, on its ideals. The legend of Havelok the Dane, with its popularity and widespread influence, is one result of Danish supremacy. It is thought that the origin of he legend, which contains a twofold version of the common story of the cruel guardian and the persecuted heir, is to be found in Wales ; but, however that may be, it is certain that in the continual rise and fall of small tribal kingdoms, Celtic or Teutonic, English or Danish, the circumstances out of which the story grew must have been common enough. Kings who died leaving helpless heirs to the guardianship of ambitious and wicked nobles were not rare in the early days of Britain, Wales, or Denmark ; the murder of the heir and the usurpation of the kingdom by the cruel regent were no unusual occurrences. The opportunity of localising the early legend seems to have come with the growing fame of Anlaf, or Olaf, Sihtricson, who was known to the Welsh as Abloec or Habloc. His adventurous life included a threefold expulsion from his inheritance of Northumbria, a marriage with the daughter of King Constantine III. of Scotland, and a family kinship with King Athelstan of England. In Anlaf Curan (as he was called) we have an historical hero on whom various romantic stories were gradually fathered, because of his adventurous life and his strong personality. These stories finally crystalized in a form which shows the English and Danish love of physical prowess (Havelok is the strongest man in the kingdom), as well as a certjun cruelty of revenge which is more peculiarly Danish. There is resentment of the Norman predominance to be found in the popularity of a story which shows the kitchen-boy excelling all the nobles in manly exercises, and the heiress to the kingdom wedded in scorn, as so many Saxon heiresses were after the Conquest, to a mere scullion. There can be no doubt, however, that Havelok stood to mediaeval England as a hero of the strong arm, a champion of the populace against the ruling race, and that his royal birth and dignity were a concession to historic facts and probabilities, not much regarded by the common people. The story, again, showed another truly humble hero. Grim the fisher, whose loyalty was supposed to account for the special trading privileges of his town, Grimsby. In Grim the story found a character who was in reality a hero of the poor and lowly, with the characteristic devotion of the tribesman to his chief, of the vassal to his lord, a devotion which was handed on from father to son, so that a second generation continued the services, and received the rewards, of the father who risked life and all for the sake of his king's heir. 

The reader will not fail to notice the characteristic anachronisms which give to life in Saxon England in the tenth century the colour of the Norman chivalry of the thirteenth. 

Havelok and Godard 

In Denmark, long ago, lived a good king named Birkabeyn, rich and powerful, a great warrior and a man of mighty prowess, whose rule was undisputed over the whole realm. He had three children — two daughters, named Swanborow and Elfleda the Fair, and one young and goodly son, Havelok, the heir to all when Death would call King Birkabeyn away, and he grieved sore over his young children to be left fatherless and unprotected ; but, after much reflection, and prayers to God for wisdom to help his choice, he called to him Jarl Godard, a trusted counsellor and friend, and committed into his hands the care of the realm and of the three royal children, until Havelok should be of age to be knighted and yule the land himself. King Birkabeyn felt that such a charge was too great a temptation for any man unbound by oaths of fealty and honour, and although he did not mistrust his friend, he required Godard to swear, 

"By altar and by holy service book,  
By bells that call the faithful to the church,  
By blessed sacrament, and sacred rites,  
By Holy Rood, and Him who died thereon,  
That thou wilt truly rule and keep my realm,  
Wilt guard my babes in love and loyalty,  
Until my son be grown, and dubbed knight :  
That thou wilt then resign to him his land,  
His power and rule, and all that owns his sway."

Jarl Godard took this most solemn oath at once, with many protestations of affection and whole-hearted evotion to the dying king and his heir, and King Birkabeyn died happy in the thought that his children would be well cared for during their helpless youth. 

When the funeral rites were celebrated Jarl Godard assumed the rule of the country, and, under pretext of securing the safety of the royal children, removed them to a strong castle, where no man was allowed access to them, and where they were kept so closely that the royal residence became a prison in all but name. Godard, finding Denmark submit to his government without resistance, began to adopt measures to rid himself of the real heirs to the throne, and gave orders that food and clothes should be supplied to the three children in such scanty quantities that they might die of hardship ; but since they were slow to succumb to this cruel, torturing form of murder, he resolved to slay them suddenly, knowing that no one durst call him to account. Having steeled his heart against all pitiful thoughts, he went to the castle, and was taken to the inner dungeon where the poor babes lay shivering and weeping for cold and hunger. As he entered, Havelok, who was even then a bold lad, greeted him courteously, and knelt before him, with clasped hands, begging a boon. 

" Why do you weep and wail so sore ? " asked Godard. 

"Because we are so hungry," answered Havelok. "We have so little food, and we have no servants to wait on us ; they do not give us half as much as we could eat ; we are shivering with cold, and our clothes are all in rags. Woe to us that we were ever born ! Is there in the land no more corn with which men can bake bread for us ? We are nearly dead from hunger." 

These pathetic words had no effect on Godard, who had resolved to yield to no pity and show no mercy. He seized the two little girls as they lay cowering together, clasping one another for warmth, and cut their throats, letting the bodies of the hapless babies fall to the floor in a pool of blood ; and then, turning to Havelok, aimed his knife at the boy's heart. The poor child, terrified by the awful fate of the two girls, knelt again before him and begged for mercy : 

"Fair lord, have mercy on me now, I pray !  
Look on my helpless youth, and pity me !  
Oh, let me live, and I will yield you all —  
My realm of Denmark will I leave to you,  
And swear that I will ne'er assail your sway.  
Oh, pity me, lord ! be compassionate !  
And I will flee far from this land of mine,  
And vow that Birkabeyn was ne'er my sire ! "

Jarl Godard was touched by Havelok's piteous speech, and felt some faint compassion, so that he could not slay the lad himself ; yet he knew that his only safety was in Havelok's death. 

" If I let him go," thought he, "Havelok will at last work me woe ! I shall have no peace in my life, and my children after me will not hold the lordship of Denmark in safety, if Havelok escapes ! Yet I cannot slay him with my own hands. I will have him cast into the sea with an anchor about his neck : thus at least his body will not float." 

Godard left Havelok kneeling in terror, and, striding from the tower, leaving the door locked behind him, he sent for an ignorant fisherman. Grim, who, he thought, could be frightened into doing his will. When Grim came he was led into an ante-room, where Godard, with terrible look and voice, addressed him thus : 

" Grim, thou knowest thou art my thrall." " Yea, fair lord," quoth Grim, trembling at Godard's stern voice. " And I can slay thee if thou dost disobey me." " Yea, lord ; but how have I offended you ? " " Thou hast not yet ; but I have a task for thee, and if thou dost it not, dire punishment shall fall upon thee."  " Lord, what is the work that I must do ? " asked the poor fisherman. " Tarry : I will show thee." Then Godard went into the inner room of the tower, whence he returned leading a feir boy, who wept bitterly. "Take this boy secretly to thy house, and keep him there till dead of night ; then launch thy boat, row out to sea, and fling him therein with an anchor round his neck, so that I shall see him never again."

Grim lodked curiously at the weeping boy, and said: "What reward shall I have if I work this sin for you ?"

Godard replied : " The sin will be on my head, as I am thy lord and bid thee do it ; but I will make thee a freeman, noble and rich, and my friend, if thou wilt do his secretly and discreetly." 

Thus reassured and bribed, Grim suddenly took the boy, flung him to the ground, and bound him hand and foot with cord which he took from his pockets. So anxious was he to secure the boy that he drew the cords very tight, and Havelok sufrered terrible pain ; he could not cry out, for a handful of rags was thrust into his mouth and over his nostrils, so that he could hardly breathe. Then Grim flung the poor boy into a horrible black sack, and carried him thus from the castle, as if he were bringing home broken food for his family. When Grim reached his poor cottage, where his wife Leve was waiting for him, he slung the sack from his shoulder and gave it to her, saying, 
"Take good care of this boy as of thy life. I am to drown him at midnight, and if I do so my lord has promised to make me a free man and give me great wealth." 

When Dame Leve heard this she sprang up and flung the lad down in a corner, and nearly broke his head with the crash against the earthen floor. There Havelok lay, bruised and aching, while the couple went to sleep, leaving the room all dark but for the red glow from the fire. At midnight Grim awoke to do to lord's behest, and Dame Leve, going to the living-room to kindle a light, was terrified by a mysterious gleam as bright as day which shone around the boy on the floor and streamed from his mouth. Leve hastily called Grim to see this wonder, and together they released Havelok from the gag and bonds and examined his body, when they found on the right shoulder the token of true royalty, a cross of red gold.

" God knows," quoth Grim, " that this is the heir of our land. He will come to rule in good time, will bear sway over England and Denmark, and will punish the cruel Godard." Then, weeping sore, the loyal fisherman fell down at Havelok's feet, crying, " Lord, have mercy on me and my wife ! We are thy thralls, and ever will we do aught against thee. We will nourish thee until thou canst rule, and will hide thee from Godard ; and thou wilt perchance give me my freedom in return for thy life." 

At this unexpected address Havelok sat up surprised, and rubbed his bruised head and said : " I am nearly dead, what with hunger, and thy cruel bonds, and the bag. Now bring me food in plenty ! " " Yea, lord," said Dame Leve, and bustled about, bringing the best they had in the hut ; and Havelok ate as if he had fasted for three days ; and then he was put to bed, and slept in peace while Grim watched over him. 

However, Grim went the next morning to Jarl Godard and said : " Lord, I have done your behest, and drowned the boy with an anchor about his neck. He is safe, and now, I pray you, give me my reward, the gold and ther treasures, and make me a freeman as you have promised." But Godard only looked fiercely at him and said : " What, wouldst thou be an earl ? Go home, thou foul churl, and be ever a thrall ! It is enough reward that I do not hang thee now for insolence, and or thy wicked deeds. Go speedily, else thou mayst stand and palter with me too long." And Grim shrank quietly away, lest Godard should slay him for the murder of Havelok.

Now Grim saw in what a terrible plight he stood, at the mercy of this cruel and treacherous man, and he took counsel with himself and consulted his wife, and the two decided to flee from Denmark to save their lives. Gradually Grim sold all his stock, his cattle, his nets, everything that he owned, and turned it into good pieces of gold ; then he bought and secretly fitted out and provisioned a ship, and at last, when all was ready, carried on board Havelok (who had lain hidden all this time), his own three sons and two daughters ; then when he and his wife had gone on board he set sail, and, driven by a favourable wind, reached the shores of England. 

Goldborough and Earl Godrich 

Meanwhile in England a somewhat similar fate had befallen a fair princess named Goldborough. When her father, King Athelwold, lay dying all his people mourned, for he was the flower of all fair England for knighthood, justice, and mercy; and he himself grieved sorely for the sake of his little daughter, soon to be left an orphan, " What will she do ? " moaned he. " She can neither speak nor walk ! If she were only able to ride, to rule England, and to guard herself from shame, I should have no grief, even if I died and left her alone, while I lived in the joy of paradise ! " 

Then Athelwold summoned a council to be held at Winchester, and asked the advice of the nobles as to the care of the infant Goldborough. They with one accord recommended Earl Godrich of Cornwall to be made regent for the little princess ; and the earl, on being appointed, swore with all solemn rites that he would marry her at twelve years old to the highest, the best, fairest, and strongest man alive, and in the meantime would train her in all royal virtues and customs. So King Athelwold died, and was buried with great lamentations, and Godrich ruled the land as regent. He was a strict but just governor, and England had great peace, without and within, under his severe rule, for all lived in awe of him, though no man loved him. Goldborough grew and throve in all ways, and became famous through the land for her gracious beauty and gentle and virtuous demeanour. This roused the jealousy of Earl Godrich, who had played the part of king so long that he almost believed himself King of England, and he began to consider how he could secure the kingdom for himself and his son. Thereupon he had Goldborough taken from Winchester, where she kept royal state, to Dover, where she was mprisoned in the castle, and strictly secluded from all her friends ; there she remained, with poor clothes and scanty food, awaiting a champion to uphold her right. 

Havelok Becomes Cook's Boy 

When Grim sailed from Denmark to England he landed in the Humber, at the place now called Grimsby, and there established himself as a fisherman. So successful was he that for twelve years he supported his family well, and carried his catches of fish far afield, even to Lincoln, where rare fish always brought a good price. In all this time Grim never once called on Havelok for help in the task of feeding the family ; he reverenced his king, and the whole household served Havelok with the utmost deference, and often went with scanty rations to satisfy the boy's great appetite. At length Havelok began to think how selfishly he was living, and how much food he consumed, and was filled with shame when he realized how his foster-father toiled unweariedly while he did nothing to help. In his remorseful meditations it became clear to him that though a King's son, he ought to do seme useful work.

" Of what use," thought he, is my great strength and stature if I do not employ it for some good purpose ? There is no shame in honest toil. I will work for my food, and try to make some return to Father Grim, who has done so much for me. I will gladly bear his baskets of fish to market, and I will begin to-morrow." 

On the next day, in spite of Grim's protests, Havelok carried a load of fish equal to four men's burden to Grimsby market, and sold it successfully, returning home with the money he received ; and this he did day by day, till a famine arose and fish and food both became scarce. Then Grim, more concerned for Havelok than for his own children, called the youth to him and bade him try his fortunes in Lincoln, for his own sake and for theirs ; he would be better fed, and the little food Grim could get would go further among the others if Havelok were not there. The one obstacle in the way was Havelok's lack of clothes, and Grim overcame that by sacrificing his boat's sail to make Havelok a coarse tunic. That done, they bade each other farewell, and Havelok started for Lincoln, barefooted and bareheaded, for his only garment was the sailcloth tunic. In Lincoln Havelok found no friends and no food for two days, and he was desperate and faint with hunger, when he heard a call : " Porters, porters ! hither to me ! " Roused to new vigour by the chance of work, Havelok rushed with the rest, and bore down and hurled aside the other porters so vigorously that he was chosen to carry provisions for Bertram, the earl's cook ; and in return he received the first meal he had eaten for nearly three days. 

On the next day Havelok again overthrew the porters, and, knocking down at least sixteen, secured the work. This time he had to carry fish, and his basket was so laden that he bore nearly a cartload, with which he ran to the castle. There the cook, amazed at is strength, first gave him a hearty meal, and then offered him good service under himself, with food and lodging for his wages. This offer Havelok accepted, and was installed as cook's boy, and employed in all the lowest offices— carrying wood, water, turf, hewing logs, lifting, fetching, carrying — and in all he showed himself a wonderfully strong worker, with unfailing good temper and gentleness, so that the little children all loved the big, gentle, fair-haired youth, who worked so quietly and played with them so merrily. When Havelok's old tunic became worn out, his master, the cook, took pity on him and gave him a new suit, and then it could be seen how handsome and tall and strong a youth this cook's boy really was, and his fame spread far and wide round Lincoln Town. 

Havelok and Goldborough 

At the great fair of Lincoln, sports of all kinds were indulged in, and in these Havelok took his part, for the cook, proud of his mighty scullion, urged him to compete in all the games and races. As Earl Godrich had summoned his Parliament to meet that year at Lincoln, there was a great concourse of spectators, and even the powerful Earl Regent himself sometimes watched the sports and cheered the champions. The first contest was "putting the stone," and the stone chosen was so weighty that none but the most stalwart could lift it above the knee — none could raise it to his breast. This sport was new to Havelok, who had never seen it before, but when the cook bade him try his strength he lifted the stone easily and threw it more than twelve feet. This mighty deed caused his fame to be spread, not, only among the poor servants with whom Havelok was classed, but also among the barons, their masters, and Havelok's Stone became a landmark in Lincoln. Thus Godrich heard of a youth who stood head and shoulders taller than other men, and was stronger, more handsome — and yet a mere common scullion. The news brought him a flash of inspiration : " Here is the highest, strongest, best man in all England, and him shall Goldborough wed. I shall keep my vow to the letter, and England must fall to me, for Goldborough's royal blood will be lost by her marriage with a thrall, the people will refuse her obedience, and England will cast her out." 

Godrich therefore brought Goldborough to Lincoln, received her with bell-ringing and seemly rejoicing, and bade her prepare for her wedding. This the princess refused to do until she knew who was her destined husband, for she said she would wed no man who was not of royal birth. Her firmness drove Earl Godrich to fierce wrath, and he burst out : " Wilt thou be queen and mistress over me ? Thy pride shall be brought down : thou shalt have no royal spouse : a vagabond and scullion shalt thou wed, and that no later than to-morrow ! Curses on him who speaks thee fair ! " In vain the princess wept and bemoaned herself : the wedding was fixed for the morrow morn. 

The next day at dawn Earl Godrich sent for Havelok, the mighty cook's boy, and asked him : " Wilt hou take a wife ? " 

" Nay," quoth Havelok, "that will I not. I cannot feed her, much less clothe and lodge her. My very garments are not my own, but belong to the cook, my master." Godrich fell upon Havelok and beat him furiously, saying, " Unless thou wilt take the wench I give thee for wife I will hang or blind thee " ; and so, in great fear, Havelock agreed to the wedding. At once Goldborough was brought, and forced into an immediate marriage, under penalty of banishment or burning as a witch if she refused. And thus the unwilling couple were united by the Archbishop of York, who had come to attend the Parliament.

Never was there so sad a wedding ! The people murmured greatly at this unequal union, and pitied the poor princess, thus driven to wed a man of low birth ; and Goldborough herself wept pitifully, but resigned herself to God's will. All men now acknowledged with grief that she and her husband could have no claim to the English throne, and thus Godrich seemed to have gained his object. Havelok and his unwilling bride recognised that they would not be safe near Godrich, and as Havelok had no home in Lincoln to which he could take the princess, he determined to go back to his faithful foster-father, Grim, and put the fair young bride under his loyal protection. Sorrowfully, with grief and shame in their hearts, Havelok and Goldborough made their way on foot to Grimsby, only to find the loyal Grim dead ; but his five children were alive and in prosperity. When they saw Havelok and his wife they fell on their knees and saluted them with all respect and reverence. In their joy to see their king again, these worthy fisherfolk forgot their newly won wealth, and said ; " Welcome, dear lord, and thy fair lady ! What joy is ours to see thee again, for thy subjects are we, and thou canst do with us as thou wilt. All that we have is thine, and if thou wilt dwell with us we will serve thee and thy wife truly in all ways ! " This greeting surprised Goldborough, who began to suspect some mystery, and she was greatly comforted when brothers and sisters busied themselves in lighting fires, cooking meals, and waiting on her hand and foot, as if she had been indeed a king's wife. Havelok, however, said nothing to explain the mystery, and Goldborough that night lay awake bewailing her fate as a thrall's bride, even though he was the fairest man in England. 

The Rerelation and Return to Denmark 

As Goldborough lay sleepless and unhappy she became aware of a brilliant light shining around Havelok, and streaming from his mouth ; and while she feared and wondered an angelic voice cried to her : 

" Fair Princess, cease this grief and heavy moan !  
For Havelok, thy newly wedded spouse.  
Is son and heir to famous kings : the sign  
Thou findest in the cross of ruddy gold  
That shineth on his shoulder.  
He shall be monarch and ruler of two mighty realms ;  
Denmark and England shall obey his rule,  
And he shall sway them with a sure command.  
This shalt thou see with thine own eyes, and be  
Lady and Queen, with Havelok, o'er these lands."

This angelic message so gladdened Goldborough that she kissed, for the first time, her unconscious husband, who started up from his sleep, saying, " Dear love, leepest thou ? I have had a wondrous dream. I thought I sat on a lofty hill, and saw all Denmark before me. As I stretched out my arms I embraced it all, and the people clung to my arms, and the castles fell at my feet ; then I flew over the salt sea with the Danish people clinging to me, and I closed all fair England in my hand, and gave it to thee, dear love ! Now what can this mean ? "

Goldborough answered joyfully : " It means, dear heart, that thou shalt be King of Denmark and of England too : all these realms shall fall into thy power, and thou shalt be ruler in Denmark within one year. Now do thou follow my advice, and let us go to Denmark, taking with us Grim's three sons, who will accompany thee for love and loyalty ; and have no fear, for I know thou wilt succeed."

The next morning Havelok went to church early, and prayed humbly and heartily for success in his enterprise and retribution on the false traitor Godard ; then, laying is offering on the altar before the Cross, he went away glad in heart. Grim's three sons, Robert the Red, William Wendut, and Hugh the Raven, joyfully consented to go with Havelok to Denmark, to attack with all their power the false Jarl Godard and to win the kingdom for the rightful heir. Their wives and families stayed in England, but Goldborough would not leave her husband, and after a short voyage the party landed safely on the shores of Denmark, in the lands of Jarl Ubbe, an old friend of King Birkabeyn, who lived far rom the court now that a usurper held sway in Denmark. 

Havelok and Ubbe 

Havelok dared not reveal himself and his errand until he knew more of the state of parties in the country, and he therefore only begged permission to live and trade there, giving Ubbe, as a token of goodwill and a tribute to his power, a valuable ring, which the jarl prized greatly. Ubbe, gazing at the so-called merchant's great stature and beauty, lamented that he was not of noble birth, and planned to persuade him to take up the profession of arms. At first, however, he simply granted Havelok permission to trade, and invited him and Goldborough to a feast, promising them safety and honour under his protection. Havelok dreaded lest his wife's beauty might place them in jeopardy, but he dared not refuse the invitation, which was pointedly given to both ; accordingly, when they went to Ubbe's hall, Goldborough was escorted by Robert the Red and William Wendut. 

Ubbe received them with all honour, and all men marvelled at Goldborough's beauty, and Ubbe's wife loved Goldborough at first sight as her husband did Havelok, so that the feast passed off with all joy, and mirth, and none dared raise a hand or lift his voice gainst the wandering merchant whom Ubbe so strangely favoured. But Ubbe knew that when once Havelok and his wife were away from his protection there would be little safety for them, since the rough Danish nobles would think nothing of stealing a trader's fair wife, and many a man had cast longing eyes on Goldborough's loveliness. Therefore when the feast was over, and Havelok took his leave, Ubbe sent with him a body of ten knights and sixty men-at-arms, and recommended them to the magistrate of the town, Bernard Brown, a true and upright man, bidding him, as he prized his life, keep the strangers in safety and honour. Well it was that Ubbe and Bernard Brown took these precautions, for late at night a riotous crowd came to Bernard's house clamouring for admittance. Bernard withstood the angry mob, armed with a great axe, but they burst the door in by hurling a huge stone ; and then Havelok joined in the defence. He drew out the great beam which barred the door, and crying, " Come quickly to me, and you shall stay here ! Curses on him who flees ! " began to lay about him with the big beam, so that three fell dead at once. A terrible fight followed, in which Havelok, armed only with the beam, slew twenty men in armour, and was then sore beset by the rest of the troop, aiming darts and arrows at his unarmoured breast. It was going hardly with him, when Hugh the Raven, hearing and understanding the cries of the assailants, called his brothers to their lord's aid, and they all joined the fight so furiously that, long ere day, of the sixty men who had attacked the inn not one remained alive. 

In the morning news was brought to Jarl Ubbe that his stranger guest had slain sixty of the best of his soldiery. 

" What can this mean ? " said Ubbe. " I had better go and see to it myself, for any messenger would surely treat Havelok discourteously, and I should be full loath to do that." He rode away to the house of Bernard Brown, and asked the meaning of its damaged and battered appearance. 

My lord," answered Bernard Brown, " last night at moonrise there came a band of sixty thieves who would have plundered my house and bound me hand and foot. When Havelok and his companions saw it they came to my aid, with sticks and stones, and drove out the robbers like dogs from a mill. Havelok himself slew three at one blow. Never have I seen a warrior so good ! He is worth a thousand in a fray. But alas ! he is grievously wounded, with three deadly gashes in side and arm and thigh, and at least twenty smaller wounds. I am scarcely harmed at all, but I fear he will die full soon." 

Ubbe could scarcely believe so strange a tale, but all the bystanders swore that Bernard told nothing but the bare truth, and that the whole gang of thieves, with their leader, Griffin the Welshman, had been slain by the hero and his small party. Then Ubbe bade them bring Havelok, that he might call a leech to heal his wounds, for if the stranger merchant should live Jarl Ubbe would without fail dub him knight ; and when the leech had seen the wounds he said the patient would make a good and quick recovery. Then Ubbe offered Havelok and his wife a dwelling in his own castle, under his own protection, till Havelok's grievous wounds were healed. There, too, fair Goldborough would be under the care of Ubbe's wife, who would cherish her as her own daughter. This kind offer was accepted gladly, and they all went to the castle, where a room was given them next to Ubbe's own. 

At midnight Ubbe woke, aroused by a bright light in Havelok's room, which was only separated from his own by a slight wooden partition. He was vexed, suspecting his guest of midnight wassailing, and went to inquire what villainy might be hatching. To his surprise, both husband and wife were sound asleep, but the light shone from Havelok's mouth, and made a glory round his head. Utterly amazed at the marvel, Ubbe went away silently, and returned with all the garrison of his castle to the room where his guests still lay sleeping. As they gazed on the light Havelok turned in his sleep, and they saw on his shoulder the golden cross, shining like the sun, which all men knew to be the token of royal birth. Then Ubbe exclaimed :

" Now I know who this is, and why I loved him so nearly at first sight : this is the son of our dead King Birkabeyn. Never was man so like another as this man is to the dead king : he is his very image and his true heir." With great joy they fell on their knees and kissed him eagerly, and Havelok awoke and began to scowl furiously, for he thought it was some treacherous attack ; but Ubbe soon undeceived him.

" ' Dear lord,' quoth he, ' be thou in naught dismayed.  
For in thine eyes methinks I see thy thought—  
Dear son, great joy is mine to live this day !  
My homage, lord, I freely offer thee :  
Thy loyal men and vassals are we all.  
For thou art son of mighty Birkabeyn,  
And soon shalt conquer all thy father's land,  
Though thou art young and almost friendless here.  
To-morrow will we swear our fealty due.  
And dub thee knight, for prowess unexcelled.' "

Now Havelok knew that his worst danger was over, and he thanked God for the friend He had sent him, and left to the good Jarl Ubbe the management of his cause. Ubbe gathered an assembly of as many mighty men of the realm, and barons, and good citizens, as he could summon ; and when they were all assembled, wondering what was the cause of this imperative summons, Ubbe arose and said : 

" Gentles, bear with me if I tell you first things well known to you. Ye know that King Birkabeyn ruled this land until his death-day, and that he left three children — one son, Havelok, and two daughters — to the guardianship of Jarl Godard : ye all heard him swear to keep them loyally and treat them well. But ye do not know how he kept his oath ! The false traitor slew both the maidens, and would have slain the boy, but for pity he would not kill the child with his own hands. He bade a fisherman drown him in the sea ; but when the good man knew that it was the rightful heir, he saved the boy's life and fled with him to England, where Havelok has been brought up for any years. And now, behold ! here he stands. In all the world he has no peer, and ye may well rejoice in the beauty and manliness of your king. Come now and pay homage to Havelok, and I myself will be your leader ! " 

Jarl Ubbe turned to Havelok, where he stood with Goldborough beside him, and knelt before him to do homage, an example which was followed by all present. At a second and still larger assembly held a fortnight later a similar oath of fealty was sworn by all, Havelok was dubbed knight by the noble Ubbe, and a great festival was celebrated, with sports and amusements for the populace. A council of war and vengeance was held with the great nobles. 

THe Death of Godard

Havelok, now acknowledged King of Denmark was unsatisfied until he had punished the treacherous Godard, and he took a solemn oath from his soldiers that they would never cease the search for the traitor till they had captured him and brought him bound to judgment. After aíl, Godard was captured as he was hunting. Grim's three sons, now knighted by King Havelok, met him in the forest, and bade him come to the king, who called on him to remember and account for his treatment of Birkabeyn's children. Godard struck out furiously with his fists, but Sir Robert the Red wounded him in the right arm. When Godard's men joined in the combat, Robert and his brothers soon slew ten of their adversaries, and the rest fled ; returning, ashamed at the bitter reproaches of their lord, they were all slain by Havelok's men. Godard was taken, bound hand and foot, placed on miserable jade with his face to the tail, and so led to Havelok. The king refused to be the judge of his own cause, and entrusted to Ubbe the task of presiding at the traitor's trial. No mercy was shown to the cruel Jarl Godard, and he was condemned to a traitor's death, with torments of terrible barbarity. The sentence was carried out to the letter, and Denmark rejoiced in the punishment of a cruel villain. 

Death of Godrich 

Meanwhile Earl Godrich of Cornwall had heard with great uneasiness that Havelok had become King of Denmark, and intended to invade England with a mighty army to assert his wife's right to the throne. He recognised that his own device to shame Goldorough had turned against him, and that he must now fight for his life and the usurped dominion he held over England. Godrich summoned his army to Lincoln for the defence of the realm against the Danes, and called out every man fit to bear weapons, on pain of becoming thrall if they failed him. Then he thus addressed them : 

"Friends, listen to my words, and ybo will know  
'Tis not for sport, nor idle show, that I  
Have bidden you to meet at Lincoln here.  
Lo ! here at Grimsby foreigners are come  
Who have already won the Priory.  
These Danes are cruel heathen, who destroy  
Our churches and our abbeys :  priests and nuns  
They torture to the death, or lead away  
To serve as slaves the haughty Danish jarls.  
Now, Englishmen, what counsel will ye take !  
If we submit, they will rule all our land.  
Will kill us ail, and sell our babes for thralls,  
Will take our wives and daughters for their own.  
Help me, if ever ye loved English land.  
To fight these heathen and to cleanse our soil  
From hateful presence of these alien hordes.  
I make my vow to God and all the saints  
1 will not rest, nor houseled be, nor shriven,  
Until our realm be free from Danish foe !  
Accursed be he who strikes no blow for home ! "

The army was inspired with valour by these courageous words, and the march to Grimsby began at once, with Earl Godrich in command. Havelok's men marched out gallantly to meet them, and when the battle joined many mighty deeds of valour were done, especially by the king himself, his foster-brothers, and Jarl Ubbe. The battle lasted long and was very fierce and bloody, but the Danes gradually overcame the resistance of the English, and at last, after a great hand-to-hand conflict. King Havelok captured Godrich. The traitor earl, who had lost a hand in the fray, was sent bound and fettered to Queen Goldborough, who kept him, carefully guarded, until he could be tried by his peers, since (for all his treason) he was still a knight. 

When the English recognised their rightful lady and queen they did homage with great joy, begging mercy for having resisted their lawful ruler at the command of a wicked traitor ; and the king and queen pardoned all but Godrich, who was speedily brought to trial at Lincoln. He was sentenced to be burnt at the stake, and the sentence was carried out amid general rejoicings. 

Now that vengeance was satisfied, Havelok and his wife thought of recompensing the loyal helpers who had believed in them and supported them through the long years of adversity. Havelok married one of Grim's daughters to the Earl of Chester, and the other to Bertram, the good cook, who became Earl of Cornwall in the place of the felon Godrich and his disinherited children ; the heroic Ubbe was made Regent of Denmark for Havelok, who decided to stay and rule England, and all the noble Danish warriors were rewarded with gifts of gold, and lands and castles. After a great coronation feast, which lasted for forty days, King Havelok dismissed the Danish regent and his followers, and after sad farewells they returned to their own country. Havelok and Goldborough ruled England in peace and security for sixty years, and lived together in all bliss, and had fifteen children, who all became mighty kings and queens.

CHAPTER V ; HAVELOK THE DANE 

The Origin of the Story 

The Danish occupation of England has left a very strong mark on our country in various ways — on its place-names, its racial characteristics, its language, its literature, and, in part, on its ideals. The legend of Havelok the Dane, with its popularity and widespread influence, is one result of Danish supremacy. It is thought that the origin of he legend, which contains a twofold version of the ommon story of the cruel guardian and the persecuted eir, is to be found in Wales ; but, however that may e, it is certain that in the continual rise and fall of small ribal kingdoms, Celtic or Teutonic, English or Danish, he circumstances out of which the story grew must ave been common enough. Kings who died leaving elpless heirs to the guardianship of ambitious and icked nobles were not rare in the early days of ritain, Wales, or Denmark ; the murder of the heir nd the usurpation of the kingdom by the cruel regent ere no unusual occurrences. The opportunity of ocalising the early legend seems to have come with he growing fame of Anlaf, or Olaf, Sihtricson, who as known to the Welsh as Abloec or Habloc. His dventurous life included a threefold expulsion from is inheritance of Northumbria, a marriage with the aughter of King Constantine 111. of Scotland, and a amily kinship with King Athelstan of England. In nlaf Curan (as he was called) we have an historical ero on whom various romantic stories were gradually athered, because of his adventurous life and his strong ersonality. These stories finally crystalized in a orm which shows the English and Danish love of hysical prowess (Havelok is the strongest man in the 

73 



HERO MYTHS AND LEGENDS ingdom), as well as a certjun cruelty of revenge hich is more peculiarly Danish. There is resentment f the Norman predominance to be found in the opularity of a story which shows the kitchen-boy xcelling all the nobles in manly exercises, and the eiress to the kingdom wedded in scorn, as so many axon heiresses w»rc after the Conquest, to a mere cullion. There can be no doubt, however, that avelok stood to mediaeval England as a hero of the trong arm, a champion of the populace against the uling race, and that his royal birth and dignity were a oncession to historic facts and probabilities, not much egarded by the common people. The story, again, howed another truly humble hero. Grim the fisher, hose loyalty was supposed to account for the special rading privileges of his town, Grimsby. In Grim the tory found a character who was in reality a hero of he poor and lowly, with the characteristic devotion of he tribesman to his chief, of the vassal to his lord, a evotion which was handed on from father to son, so hat a second generation continued the services, and eceived the rewards, of the fether who risked life and ll for the sake of his king’s heir. 

The reader will not fail to notice the characteristic nachronisms which give to life in Saxon England in he tenth century the colour of the Norman chivalry of he thirteenth. 

Havelok and Godard 

In Denmark, long ago, lived a good king named irkabeyn, rich and powerful, a great warrior and a an of mighty prowess, whose rule was undisputed ver the whole realm. He had three children — two aughters, named Swanborow and Elfleda the Fair, and ne young and goodly son, Havelok, the heir to all 
74 



HAVELOK AND GODARD 

his dominions. All too soon came the day that no an can avoid, when Death would call King Birkabeyn way, and he grieved sore over his young children to e left fatherless and unprotected ; but, after much eflection, and prayers to God for wisdom to help is choice, he called to him Jarl Godard, a trusted ounsellor and friend, and commi'-ted into his hands he care of the realm and of the three royal children, ntil Havelok should be of age to be knighted and ule the land himself. King Birkabeyn felt that such a harge was too great a temptation for any man unbound y oaths of fealty and honour, and although he did not istrust his friend, he required Godard to swear, 

** By altar and by holy service book. 

By bells that call the faithful to the church, 

By blessed sacrament, and sacred rites, 

By Holy Rood, and Him who died thereon, 

That thou wilt truly rule and keep my realm, 

Wilt guard my babes in love and loyalty, 

Until my son be grown, and dubbed knight : 

That thou wilt then resign to him his land, 

His power and rule, and all that owns his sway.” 

Jarl Godard took this most solemn oath at once, ith many protestations of affection and whole-hearted evotion to the dying king and his heir, and King irkabeyn died happy in the thought that his children ould be well cared for during their helpless youth. 

When the funeral rites were celebrated Jarl Godard ssumed the rule of the country, and, under pretext of ecuring the safety of the royal children, removed them o a strong castle, where no man was allowed access to hem, and where they were kept so closely that the oyal residence became a prison in all but name. odard, finding Denmark submit to his government ithout resistance, began to adopt measures to rid 

75 



HERO MYTHS AND LEGENDS imself of the real heirs to the throne, and gave orders hat food and clothes should be supplied to the three hildren in such scanty quantities that they might die of ardship ; but since they were slow to succumb to this ruel, torturing form of murder, he resolved to slay hem suddenly, knowing that no one durst call him to ccount. Having steeled his heart against all pitiful houghts, he went to the castle, and was taken to the nner dungeon where the poor babes lay shivering and eeping for cold and hunger. As he entered, Havelok, ho was even then a bold lad, greeted him courteously, nd knelt before him, with clasped hands, begging a oon. 

“ Why do you weep and wail so sore ? ” asked odard. 

Because we are so hungry,” answered Havelok. 
“We have so little food, and we have no servants to ait on us ; they do not give us half as much as we ould eat ; we are shivering with cold, and our clothes re all in rags. Woe to us that we were ever born ! Is here in the land no more corn with which men can ake bread for us ? We are nearly dead from hunger.” 

These pathetic words had no effect on Godard, who ad resolved to yield to no pity and show no mercy. e seized the two little girls as they lay cowering ogether, clasping one another for warmth, and cut their hroats, letting the bodies of the hapless babies fall to he floor in a pool of blood ; and then, turning to avelok, aimed his knife at the boy’s heart. The poor hild, terrified by the awful fate of the two girls, knelt gain before him and begged for mercy : 

Fair lord, have mercy on me now, I pray ! 

Look on my helpless youth, and pity me ! 

Oh, let me live, and I will yield you all — 

My realm of Denmark will I leave to you, 


76 



HAVELOK AND GODARD 

And swear that I will ne’er assail your sway. 

Oh, pity me, lord ! be compassionate ! 

And I will flee far from this land of mine, 

And vow that Birkabeyn was ne’er my sire ! ” 

Jarl Godard was touched by Havelok’s piteous speech, nd felt some faint compassion, so that he could not lay the lad himself ; yet he knew that his only safety as in Havelok’s death. 

“ If I let him go,” thought he, “Havelok will at last ork me woe I I shall have no peace in my life, and y children after me will not hold the lordship of Den- ark in safety, if Havelok escapes 1 Yet I cannot slay im with my own hands. I will have him cast into the ea with an anchor about his neck : thus at least his ody will not float.” 

Godard left Havelok kneeling in terror, and, striding rom the tower, leaving the door locked behind him, he ent for an ignorant fisherman. Grim, who, he thought, ould be frightened into doing his will. When Grim ame he was led into an ante-room, where Godard, with errible look and voice, addressed him thus : 

“ Grim, thou knowest thou art my thrall.” ** Yea, air lord,” quoth Grim, trembling at Godard’s stern oice. “ And I can slay thee if thou dost disobey me.” 
“ Yea, lord ; but how have I offended you ? ” “ Thou 

hast not yet ; but I have a task for thee, and if thou ost it not, dire punishment shall fall upon thee.” 
“ I.ord, what is the work that I must do ? ” asked the oor fisherman. Tarry : I will show thee.” Then odard went into the inner room of the tower, whence e returned leading a feir boy, who wept bitterly. 
“Take this boy secretly to thy house, and keep him here till dead of night ; then launch thy boat, row out o sea, and fling him therein with an anchor round his eck, so that 1 shall see him never again.” 


77 



HERO kyTHS AND LECENDS 

Grim lodkfid curiously at the weeping boy, and srid: 
“What reward shall I have if I work this «n for ou ?” 

Godard replied : “ The sin will be on my hcad^ as I m thy lord and bid thee do it ; but I will make thee a reeman, noble and rich, and my friend, if thou wilt do his secretly and disgreedy.” 

Thus reassured and bribed, Grim suddenly took the oy, flung him to the ground, and bound him hand nd foot with cord which he took from his pockets. o anxious was he to secure the bOT that he drew the ords very tight, and Haveiok sufrered terrible pain ; e could not cry out, for a handful of rags was thrust nto his mouth and over his nostrils, so that he could ardly breathe. Then Grim flung the poor boy into a orrible black sack, and carried him thus from the astle, as if he were bringing home broken food for his limily. When Grim reached his poor cottage, where is wife Leve was waiting for him, he slung the ack from his shoulder and gave it to her, saying, 
“Take good care of this boy as of thy life. 1 am to rown mm at midnight, and if I do so my lord has romised to make me a free man and give me great ealth.” 

When Dame Leve heard this she sprang up and lung the lad down in a comer, and nearly broke his ead with the crash against the earthen floor. There aveiok lay, bridsed and aching, while the couple ent to sleep, leatdng the room all dark but for the ed glow frx)m the Are. At midnight Grim awoke to o to lord’s behest, and Dame Leve, going to the iving-room to kindle a light, was terrified by a ysterious gleam as bright as day which shone around he boy on the floor and streamed from his mouth. eve hastily .called Grim to see this wonder, and

HAVELOK AND GODARD ogether they released Havelok from the gag and onds and examined his body, when they found on the ight shoulder the token of true royalty, a ctoss of red 

“ God knows,” quoth Grim, “ that this is the heir of ur land. He will come to rule in good time, will bear way over England and Denmark, and will punish the ruel Godard.” Then, weeping sore, the loyal fisher- an fell down at Havelok’s feel^ crying, “ Lord, have ercy on me and my wife I We are thy thralls, and ever will we do aught against thee. We will nourish hee until thou canst rule, and will hide thee from odard ; and thou wilt perchance give me my freedom n return for thy life.” 

At this unexpected address Havelok sat up surprised, nd rubbed his bruised head and said : “ I am nearly ead, what with hunger, and thy cruel bonds, and the ag. Now bring me food in plenty 1 ” “ Yea, lord,” aid Dame Leve, and bustled about, bringing the best hey had in the hut ; and Havelok ate as if he had asted for three days ; and then he was put to bed, and lept in peace while Grim watched over him. 

However, Grim went the next morning to Jarl Godard nd said : ” Lord, I have done your behest, and drowned he boy with an anchor about his neck. He is safe, nd now, I pray you, give me my reward, the gold and ther treasures, and make me a freeman as you have romised.” But Godard only looked fiercely at him nd said : “ What, wouldst thou be an earl ? Go home, hou foul churl, and be ever a thrall ! Tt is enough eward that I do not hang thee now for insolence, and or thy wicked deeds. Go speedily, else thou mayst tand and palter with me too long.” And Grim shrank uietly away, lest Godard should slay him for the urder of Havelok

Gradually Grim sold all his stock, his cattle, his ets, everything that he owned, and turned it into good ieces of gold ; then he bought and secretly fitted out nd provisioned a ship, and at last, when all was ready, arried on board Havelok (who had lain hidden all this ime), his own three sons and two daughters ; then hen he and his wife had gone on board he set sail, nd, driven by a favourable wind, reached the shores of ngland. 

Goldborough and Earl Godrich 

Meanwhile in England a somewhat similar fate had efallen a fair princess named Goldborough. When er father. King Athelwold, lay dying all his people ourned, for he was the flower of all fair England for nighthood, justice, and mercy; and he himself grieved orely for the sake of his little daughter, soon to be left n orphan, “ What will she do ? ” moaned he. “ She an neither speak nor walk 1 If she were only able to ide, to rule England, and to guard herself from shame, 

I should have no grief, even if I died and left her lone, while 1 lived in the joy of paradise ! ” 

Then Athelwold summoned a council to be held at Tinchester, and asked the advice of the nobles as to he care of the infant Goldborough. They with one ccord recommended Earl Godrich of Cornwall to be ade regent for the little princess ; and the earl, on eing appointed, swore with all solemr rites that he ould marry her at twelve years old to the highest, he best, fairest, and strongest man alive, and in the eantime would trsun her in aU royal virtues and

customs. So King Athelwold died, and was buried ith great lamentations, and Godrich ruled the land as egent. He was a strict but just governor, and England ad great peace, without and within, under his severe ule, for all lived in awe of him, though no man loved im. Goldborough grew and throve in all ways, and ecame famous through the land for her gracious eauty and gentle and virtuous demeanour. This oused the jealousy of Earl Godrich, who had played he part of king so long that he almost believed him- elf King of England, and he began to consider how e could secure the kingdom for himself and his son. hereupon he had Goldborough taken from Winchester, here she kept royal state, to Dover, where she was mprisoned in the castle, and strictly secluded from all er friends ; there she remained, with poor clothes and canty food, awaiting a champion to uphold her right. 

Havelok Becomes Cook's Boy 

When Grim sailed from Denmark to England he anded in the Humber, at the place now called Grimsby, nd there established himself as a fisherman. So suc- essful was he that for twelve years he supported his amily well, and carried his catches of fish far afield, ven to Lincoln, where rare fish always brought a good rice. In all this time Grim never once called on avelok for help in the task of feeding the family ; he everenced his king, and the whole household served avelok with the utmost deference, and often went ith scanty rations to satisfy the boy’s great appetite. t length Havelok began to think how selfishly he as living, and how much food he consumed, and was illed with shame when he realized how his foster-father oiled unweariedly while he did nothing to help. In is remorseful meditations it became clear to him that.

though a lung’s son, he ought td do seme useful wdrk. 
“ Of what use," thought he, is mjr grdit strength and tature if I do not employ it for some good purpose ? here is no shame in honest toil. I wiU work for my ood, and try to make some return to Father Grim, ho has done so much for me. I will gladly bear his askets of fish to market, and I will begin to-morrow." 

On the next day, in spite of Grim’s protests, avelok carried a load of nsh equal to four men's urden to Grimsby market, and sold it successfully, eturning home with the money he received ; and this e did day by day, till a &mine arose and fish and ood both became scarce. Then Grim, more concerned or Havelok than for his own children, called the youth o him and bade him try his fortunes in Lincoln, for is own sake and for theirs ; he would be better fed, nd the little food Grim could get would go further mong the others if Havelok were not there. The one bstacle in the way was Havelok’s lack of clothes, and rim overcame tiiat by sacrificing his boat’s sail to ake Havelok a coarse tunic. That done, they bade ach other farewell, and Havelok started for Lincoln, arefooted and bareheaded, for his only garment was he sailcloth tunic. In Lincoln Havelok found no riends and no food for two days, and he was desperate nd faint with hunger, when he heard a call : “ Porters, orters 1 hither to me ! ’’ Roused to new vigour by he chance of work, Havelok rushed with the rest, nd bore down and hurled aside the other porters so igorously that he was chosen to carry provisions for ertram, the earl’s cook ; and in return he received he first meal he had eaten for nearly three days. 

On the next day Havelok agsdn overthrew the orters, and, knocking down at least sixteen, secured the ork. This time he had to cany fish, and his basket

There the cook, amaaed at is stren|;th, first ^ve him a^heartjr meal, and theil ffered him good service under himself, with food and odging for his. wages. This offer Havelok accepted, nd was installed as cook’s boy, and employed in all the owest offices— Harrying wood, water, turf, hewing logs, ifting, fetching, carrying — and in all he showed him- elf a wonderfully strong worker, with unfailing good emper and gentleness, so that the little children aD oved the big, gentle, fair-haired youth, who worked o quietly and played with them so merrily. When avelok’s old tunic became worn out, his master, the ook, took pity on him and gave him a new suit, and hen it could be seen how handsome and tall and strong  youth this cook’s boy really was, and his fame spread ar and wide round Lincoln Town. 

Havelok and Goldborough 

At the great feir of Lincoln, sports of all kinds were ndulged in, and in these Havelok took his part, for he cook, proud of his mighty scullion, urged him to ompete in all the games and races. As Earl Godrich ad summoned his Parliament to meet that year at incoln, there was a great concourse of spectators, nd even the powerful Earl Regent himself sometimes atched the sports and cheered the champions. The irst contest was “putting the stone,” and the stone hosen was so weighty that none but the nic^t stalwart ould lift it above the knee — none could ruse it to his reast. This sport was new to Havelok, who had ever seen it before, but when the xook bade him try is strength he lifted the stone easily and threw it ore than twelve feet. This mighty deed caused his ame to be spread, not, only among the poor servants 



HERO MYTHS AND LEGENDS ith whom Havelok was ckssed, but also among the arons, their masters, and Havelok’s Stone became a andmark in Lincoln. Thus Godrich heard of a youth ho stood head and shoulders taller than other men, nd was stronger, more handsome — ^and yet a mere ommon scullion. The news brought him a flash of nspiration : ** Here is the highest, strongest, best man n all England, and him shall Goldborough wed. I hall keep n^ vow to the letter, and England must fall o me, for Goldborough’s royal blood will be lost by er marriage with a thrall, the people will refuse her bedience, and England will cast her out” 

Godrich therefore brought Goldborough to Lincoln, eceived her with bell-ringing and seemly rejoicing, nd bade her prepare for her wedding. This the rincess refused to do until she knew who was her estined husband, for she said she would wed no man ho was not of royal birth. Her firmness drove Earl odrich to fierce wrath, and he burst out : “ Wilt thou e queen and mistress over me ? Thy pride shall be rought down : thou shalt have no royal spouse : a agabond and scullion shalt thou wed, and that no ater than to-morrow ! Curses on him who speaks thee air I ” In vain the princess wept and bemoaned her- elf : the wedding was fixed for the morrow morn. 

The next day at dawn Earl Godrich sent for Have- ok, the mighty cook’s boy, and asked him : Wilt hou take a wife ? ” 

“ Nay,” quoth Havelok, that will I not I cannot eed her, much less clothe and lodge her. My very arments are not my own, but belong to the cook, my aster.” Godrich fell upon Havemk and beat him uriously, saying, “ Unless thou wilt take the wench I ive thee for wife I will hang or blind thee ” ; and so, n great fear, Havelock agreed to the wedding.

Havelok, however. 



HERO MYTHS AND LEGENDS aid nothing to explain the mystery, and Goldborough hat night lay awake bewiuling her fate as a thrau’s ride, even though he was the ^est man in England. 

The Rerelation and Retora to Denmark 

As Goldborough lay sleepless and unhappy she be- ame aware of a brilliant light shining around Havelok, nd streaming from his mouth ; and while she feared nd wondered an angelic voice cried to her : 

" Fair Princess, cease this grief and heavy moan ! 

For Havelok, thy newly wedded spouse. 

Is son and heir to famous kings : the sign hou findest in the cr^ of ruddy gold hat shineth on his shoulder. He shall be onarch and ruler of two mighty realms ; 

Denmark and England shall obey his rule, 

And he shall sway them with a sure command. 

This shalt thou see with thine own eyes, and be ady and Queen, with Havelok, o’er these lands.” 

This angelic message so gladdened Goldborough that he kissed, for the first time, her unconscious husband, ho started up from his sleep, saying, “ Dear love, leepest thou ? I have had a wondrous dream. I hought I sat on a lofty hill, and saw all Denmark efore me. As I stretched out my arms I embraced it ll, and the people clung to my arms, and the castles ell at my feet ; then 1 flew over the salt sea with the anish people clinging to me, and I closed all fair ngland in my hand, and gave it to thee, dear love 1 ow what can this mean ? ” 

Goldborough answered joyfully : “ It means, dear eart, that thou shalt be King of Denmark and of Eng- and too : all these realms shall fall into thy power, and hou shalt be ruler in Denmark within one year. Now o thou follow my advice, and let us go to Denmark, aking with us Grim’s three son.s, who will accompany

thee for love and lo^ty ; and have no fear, for I know hou wilt succeed.” 

The next morning Havelok went to church early, and rayed humbly and heartily for success in his enterprise nd retribution on the false traitor Godard ; then, laying is offering on the altar before the Cross, he went away lad in heart. Grim’s three sons, Robert the Red, illiam Wendut, and Hugh the Raven, joyfully con- ented to go with Havelok to Denmark, to attack with ll their power the false Jarl Godard and to win the ingdom for the rightful heir. Their wives and Emilies tayed in England, but Goldborough would not leave er husband, and after a short voyage the party landed afely on the shores of Denmark, in the lands of Jarl bbe, an old friend of King Birkabeyn, who lived far rom the court now that a usurper held sway in Denmark. 

Havelok and Ubbe 

Havelok dared not reveal himself and his errand ntil he knew more of the state of parties in the ountry, and he therefore only begged permission to ive and trade there, giving Ubbe, as a token of good- ill and a tribute to his power, a valuable ring, which he jarl prized greatly. Ubbe, gazing at the so-called erchant’s great stature and beauty, lamented that he as not of noble birth, and planned to persuade him o take up the profession of arms. At first, however, e simply granted Havelok permission to trade, and nvited him and Goldborough to a feast, promising hem safety and honour under his protection. Have- ok dreaded lest his wife’s beauty might place them in eopardy, but he dared not refuse the invitation, which as pointedly given to both ; accordingly, when they ent to Ubbe’s hall, Goldborough was escorted by obert the Red and William Wendut. 


87 



HERO MYTHS AND LEtiENDS bbe received them with all honour, and all men arvelled at Goldborough’s beauty, and Ubbe’s wife oved Goldborough at first sight as her husband did avelok, so that the feast passed off with all joy. and irth, and none dared raise a hand or lift his voice gainst the wandering merchant whom Ubbe so strangely 
^voured. But Ubbe knew that when once Havelok nd his wife were away from his protection there would e little safety for them, since the rough Danish nobles ould think nothing of stealing a trader’s fair wife, and any a man had cast longing eyes on Goldborough’s oveliness. Therefore when the feast was over, and avelok took his leave, Ubbe sent with him a body ot en knights and sixty men-at-arms, and recommended hem to the magistrate of the town, Bernard Brown,  true and upright man, bidding him, as he prized is life, keep the strangers in safety and honour. Well t was that Ubbe and Bernard Brown took these pre- autions, for late at night a riotous crowd came to ernard’s house clamouring for admittance. Bernard ithstood the angry mob, armed with a great axe, but hey burst the door in by hurling a huge stone ; and hen Havelok joined in the defence. He drew out the reat beam which barred the door, and crying, “ Come uickly to me, and you shall stay here ! Curses on him ho flees I ” began to lay about him with the big beam, so hat three fell dead at once. A terrible fight followed, in hich Havelok, armed only with the beam, slew twenty en in armour, and was then sore beset by the rest of the roop, aiming darts and arrows at his unarmoured breast. t was going hardly with him, when Hugh the Raven, earing and understanding the cries of the assailants, alled his brothers to their lord’s aid, and they all joined he fight so furiously that, long ere day, of the sixty men ho had att^ked the inn not one remained alive.

In tile morning hews ms brought to Jarl Ubbe that is Stranger guest had slain sixty of the best of his oldiery. 

** what can this mean ? ” said Ubbe. ** I had better o and see to it myself, for any messenger would urely treat Havelok discourteously, and 1 should be ull loath to do that.” He rode away to the house of ernard Brown, and asked the meaning of its damaged nd battered appearance. 

My lord,” answered Bernard Brown, “ last night t moonrise there came a band of sixty thieves who ould have plundered my house and bound me hand nd foot. When Havelok and his companions saw it hey came to my aid, with sticks and stones, and drove ut the robbers like dogs from a mill. Havelok himself lew three at one blow. Never have I seen a warrior o good 1 He is worth a thousand in a fray. But las ! he is grievously wounded, with three deadly ashes in side and arm and thigh, and at least twenty maller wounds. I am scarcely harmed at all, but 1 ear he will die full soon.” 

Ubbe could scarcely believe so strange a tale, but all he bystanders swore that Bernard told nothing but the are truth, and that the whole gang of thieves, with heir leader, Griffin the Welshman, had been slain by he hero and his small party. Then Ubbe bade them ring Havelok, that he might call a leech to heal his ounds, for if the stranger merchant should live Jarl bbe would without fril dub him knight ; and when the eech had seen the wounds he said the patient would ake a good and quick recovery. Then Ubbe offered avelok and his wife a dwelling in his own castle, nder his own protection, till Havelok’s grievous ounds were healed. There, tod, feir Goldborough ould be under the care of Ubbe’s wife, tvho would 

89 



HERO MYTHS AND LEGENDS herish her as her own daughter. This kind offer was ccepted gladly, and they all went to the castle, where a oom was given them next to Ubbe’s own. 

At midnight Ubbe woke, aroused by a bright light n Havelok’s room, which was only separated from his wn by a slight wooden partition. He was vexed, uspecting his guest of midnight wassailing, and went o inquire what vdlainy might be hatching. To his urprise, both husband and wife were sound asleep, but he light shone from Havclok’s mouth, and made a lory round his head. Utterly amazed at the marvel, bbe went away silently, and returned with all the arrison of his castle to the room where his guests till lay sleeping. As they gazed on the light Havelok urned in his sleep, and they saw on his shoulder the olden cross, shining like the sun, which all men knew o be the token of royal birth. Then Ubbe exclaimed ; 
“ Now 1 know who this is, and why I loved him so early at first sight : this is the son of our dead King irkabeyn. Never was man so like another as this man s to the dead king : he is his very image and his true eir.” With great joy they fell on their knees and issed him eagerly, and Havelok awoke and began to cowl furiously, for he thought it was some treacherous ttack ; but Ubbe soon undeceived him. 

“ ‘ Dear lord,’ cjuoth he, ‘ be thou in naught dismayed. 

For in thine eyes methinks I see thy thought— 

Dear son, great joy is mine to live this day ! 

My homage, lord, I freely offer thee : 

Thy loyal men and vassals are we all. 

For thou art son of mighty Birkabeyn, 

And soon shalt conquer all thy father’s land, 

Though thou art young and almost friendless here. o-morrow will we swear our fealty due. 

And dub thee knight, for prowess unexcelled.’ ” 

Now Havelok knew that his worst danger was over,

HAVELOK AND UBBE 


and he thanked God for the friend He had sent him, nd left to the good Jarl Ubbe the management of his ause. Ubbe gathered an assembly of as many mighty en of the realm, and barons, and good citizens, as he ould summon ; and when they were all assembled, ondering what was the cause of this imperative ummons, Ubbe arose and said : 

“ Gentles, bear with me if I tell"you first things well nown to you. Ye know that King Birkabeyn ruled his land until his death-day, and that he left three hildren — one son, Havelok, and two daughters — to the uardianship of Jarl Godard : ye all heard him swear o keep them loyally and treat them well. But ye do ot know how he kept his oath 1 The false traitor lew both the maidens, and would have slain the boy, ut for pity he would not kill the child with his own ands. He bade a fisherman drown him in the sea ; 


but when the good man knew that it was the right- ul heir, he saved the boy’s life and fled with him to ngland, where Havelok has been brought up for any years. And now, behold ! here he stands. In ll the world he has no peer, and ye may well rejoice n the beauty and manliness of your king. Come now nd pay homage to Havelok, and I myself will be yoxu* 


leader ! ” 


Jarl Ubbe turned to Havelok, where he stood with oldborough beside him, and knelt before him to do omage, an example which was followed by all present. t a second and still larger assembly held a fortnight ater a similar oath of fealty was sworn by all, Havelok as dubbed knight by the noble Ubbe, and a great estival was celebrated, with sports and amusements for he populace. A council of war and vengeance was eld with the great nobles.

Friends, listen to my words, and ybo will know 
*Tis not for sport, nor idle show, that 1 ave bidden you to meet at Lincoln here. 

Lo ! here at Grimsby foreigners are come ho have already won the Priory. 

These Danes are cruel heathen, who destroy ur churches and our abbeys : priests and nuns hey torture to the death, or lead away o serve as slaves the haughty Danish jarls. 

Now, Englishmen, what counsel will ye take 1 f we submit, they will rule all our land. 

Will kill us ail, and sell our babes for thralls, 

Will take our wives and daughters for their own. 

Help me, if ever ye loved English land. 

To fight these heathen and to cleanse our soil rom hateful presence of these alien hordes. 

I make my vow to God and all the saints 
1 will not rest, nor houseled be, nor shriven, 

Until our realm be free from Danish foe ! 

Accursed be he who strikes no blow for home ! 

The army was inspired with valour by these coura- eous words, and the march to Grimsby began at nce, with Earl Godrich in command. Havelok’s men arched out gallantly to meet them, and when the attle joined many mighty deeds of valour were done, specially by the king himself, his foster-brothers, and arl Ubbe. The battle lasted long and was very fierce nd bloody, but the Danes gradually overcame the esistance of the English, and at last, after a great hand- o-hand conflict. King Havelok captured Godrich.

Now that vengeance was satisfied, Havelok and his ife thought of recompensing the loyal helpers who ad believed in them and supported them through he long years of adversity.

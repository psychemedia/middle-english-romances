<h1>Sir Gawain and His Marriage to Lady Ragnell<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-gawain-and-his-marriage-to-lady-ragnell" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This is one of the tales I remember hearing most frequently when we first started listening to storytellers, and it is one that I have a soft spot for.</p>
<p>The core of the tale is follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>King Arthur is out hunting and gets separated from his party;  he meets a knight who would challenge him, say Gawain has taken his lands from him. Arthur must give way, promising to return by the next New Year’s Day with the answer to the question “What is it that a woman desire’s the most?” else he will cut off his head. Arthur returns to court unhappily, sets out with Gawain for anwsers, but none of them seem satisfactory. On the way to meet the Lord, Arthur meets a hideous hag. She says she has the answer, but the price is that she weds Gawain. Arthur checks with Gawain, ho says he will do what he must for his King. She gives the answer to Arthur and he gives it to the Lord; and the Lord is angry - his sister must have told Arthur.</p>
<p>Back at court, the hag arrives, eats noisily, and goes off with Gawain. He is astonished to see she is beautiful; she says she is under an enchantment, and will he have her foul by day and fair by night, or v.v. He flounders, says it is her choice. She is released from the curse and the next morning the court is surprised to see Gawain with the fair maiden.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924072606613/page/n65/mode/2up"><em>The Legend of Sir Gawain; studies upon its original scope and significance</em></a>, 1897, p48, Jessie L. Weston summarises an 1839 version of the original metrical romance by Frederic Madden in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>… In the fragmentary poem of the <em>The Marriage of Sir Gawayne</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Sir</span> <span class="pre">Gawayne,</span> <span class="pre">Madden,</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">288.]</span></code> we find the hero, in order to rescue King Arthur from the snares of a powerful enchanter, chivalrously wedding the magician’s sister, a lady of unexampled hideousness. On the marriage night she reveals herself as beautiful as she was previously repulsive, and gives her husband the choice whether he will have her beautiful by night, and hideous by day, or vice versa. Gawain, with that courtesy for which he was famous, leaves the decision to the lady; whereupon she tells him she has been laid under a spell to preserve this repulsive form till she finds a knight courteous enough ‘to give her her will.’ The spell is now broken, and she will be beautiful alike by night and by day.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A note in Percy’s 1794 edition of <em>Reliques</em> describes the state of fragmentation in the original manuscript.</p>

<p>Reliques of ancient English poetry. Consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces of our earlier poets, together with some few of later date.  1794: Vol 3

<p>with the poem p350-8</p>
<p>XIX.</p>
<p>THE ANCIENT FRAGMENT OF THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE.</p>
<p>The Second Poem in this Volume, intitled The MArriage of Sir Gawayne, having been offered to the Reader with large conjectural Supplements and Corrections, the old Fragment itself is here literally and exactiy printed from the Editor’s folio MS. with all its defects, inaccuracies, and errata; that ſuch auſtere Antiquaries, as complain that the ancient copies have not been always rigidly adhered to, may ſee how unfit for publication many of the pieces would have been if all the blunders, corruptions, and nonſenſe of illiterate Reciters and Tranſcribers had been ſuperſtitiouſly retained, without ſome attempt to correct and emend them.</p>
<p>This Ballad had moſt unfortunately ſuffered by having half of every leaf in this Part of the MS. torn away; and, as about Nine Stanzas’ generally occur in the half page now remaining, it is concluded, that the other half contained nearly the ſame number of Stanzas.</p>
</div>
<p>Structurally, the tale  poses a riddle — Sir Gromer Somer Joure’s challenge to Arthur — and then introduces several dilemmas (Arthur’s unwillingness to speak for Sir Gawain in committing him to marriage, Dame Ragnell’s question to Gawain), Dame Ragnell’s answer to the riddle — letting the other person decide — is also the answer that resolves the dilemmas.</p>
<p>Madden’s version is as follows:</p>

<p>Frederic Madden <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bib_fict_2517737/page/298/mode/2up">Syr Gawayne; a collection of ancient romance-poems, by Scotish and English authors, relating to that celebrated knight of the Round Table, with an introduction, notes, and a glossary.</a>, 1839</p>
<p>p. lxvii</p>
<p>The Weddynge of S. Gawene and Dame Ragnelle. fol. 128°.</p>
<p>Printed in the present volume, Appendix, No. VIII. This is the identical poem referred to erroneously by Warton as existing in one of the Tanner MSS. (See Notes; p. 358.) For its discovery, (after the greater part of the sheets of this work was printed off,) I am indebted to the Rev. Henry O. Coxe, Assistant Librarian of the Bodleian Library, who most kindly and promptly undertook a transcript, which was subsequently compared by myself with the Manuscript. It is, unquestionably, the original of the mutilated poem in the Percy folio, and is sufficiently curious to render its insertion in the Appendix an object of interest, although, had I been earlier aware of its existence, some change would probably have been made in the arrangement. The title in the MS. is added by a later hand, and the poem itself is very carelessly written, so that several lines appear occasionally omitted. An entire page, containing — lines, is, unfortunately, wanting.</p>

That bride so bright in bowre:<br />
And all his barons about him stoode,<br />
That were both stiffe and stowre.</p>

And cups went freely round;<br />
Before them came a faire damselle,<br />
And knelt upon the ground.</p>

And sware upon his faye,<br />
Then took his leave of the grimme Barone<br />
And faste hee rode awaye.</p>
<p>And he rode east, and he rode west,<br />
And did of all inquyre,<br />

A worse-form’d ladye than she was,<br />
No man mote ever viewe.</p>
<p>To hail the King in seemelye sorte<br />
This ladye was fulle faine;<br />

“That wilt not speake to mee;<br />
“Sir, I may chance to ease thy paine,<br />
“Though I bee Joule to see.</p>

And sware upon the roode:<br />
The secrette then the Ladye told,<br />
As lightlye well she cou’de.</p>

“As wee a hunting went—</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot, Sir Stephen bolde,<br />
They rode with them that daye;<br />
And foremoste of the companye<br />
There rode the stewarde Kaye:</p>
<p>Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,<br />
And eke Sir Garratte keene;<br />
Sir Tristram too, that gentle knight,<br />
To the forest freshe and greene.</p>
<p>And when they came to the greene forrest,<br />
Beneathe a faire holley tree,<br />
There sate that Ladye in red scarlette<br />
That unseemelye was to see.</p>
<p>Sir Kay beheld that Lady’s face,<br />
And looked upon her sweere;<br />
— “Whoever kisses that Ladye,” he sayes,<br />
“Of his kisse he stands in feare.” —</p>
<p>Sir Kay beheld that Ladye againe,<br />
And looked upon her snout;<br />
— “Whoever kisses that Ladye,” he sayes,<br />
“Of his kisse he stands in doubt” —</p>
<p>— “Peace, brother Kay,” sayde Sir Gawaine,<br />
“And amend thee of thy life;<br />
“For there is a Knight amongst us all,<br />
“Must marry her to his wife,”-—</p>
<p>— “What, marry this foule queane,” quoth Kay,<br />
“I’ the devils name anone;<br />
“Gett mee a wife wherever I maye,<br />
“In sooth shee shall be none,”—</p>
<p>Then some tooke up their hawkes in haste,<br />
And some tooke up their houndes;<br />
And sayd they wolde not many her,<br />
For cities, nor for townes.</p>
<p>Then bespake him King Arthure,<br />
And sware there by this daye;<br />
—“For a little foule sighte and mislikinge,<br />
“Yee shall not say her naye.” —</p>
<p>— “Peace, Lordings, peace;” Sir Gawaine sayd;<br />
“Nor make debate and strife;<br />
“This lothlye Ladye I will take,<br />
“And marry her to my wife”—</p>
<p>-— “Nowe thankes, nowe thankes, good Sir Gawaine,<br />
“And a blessinge be thy meede!<br />

“Thou never shalt rue this deede.” —</p>
<p>Then up they took that lothly Dame,<br />
And home anone they bringe:<br />
And there Sir Gawaine he her wed,<br />

And all were done awaye:<br />
— “Come turne to mee, mine owne wed-lord,<br />
“Come turne to mee I praye.” —</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine scant could lift his head,<br />
For sorrowe and for care;<br />
When, lo I instead of (hat lothelye Dame,<br />
Hee sawe a young Ladye faire.</p>
<p>Sweet blushes stayned her rud-red cheeke,<br />
Her eyen were blacke as sloe:<br />
The ripening cherrye swellde her lippe,<br />
And all her necke was snowe.</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine kiss’d that Lady faire,<br />
Lying upon the sheete:<br />
And swore, as he was a true Knighte,<br />
The spice was never soe sweete.</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine kiss’d that Lady brighter<br />
Lying there by his side:<br />
— “The fairest flower is not soe faire:<br />
“Thou never can st bee my bride.”—</p>
<p>— “I am thy bride, mine owne deare Lorde,<br />

“Alas I then I must hide myself,<br />

<p>— “My faire ladye,” Sir Gawaine sayd,<br />
“I yield me to thy skille;<br />
“Because thou art mine owne ladye<br />
“Thou shalt have all thy wille.” —</p>
<p>— “Nowe blessed be thou, sweete Gawaine,<br />

<p>Judging from the number of versions still extant, this curious tale must have been a great favourite during the middle ages, when it was so much the fashion to decry women and example-books of their profligacy and trickery were rife. The story is the subject of two long ballads in the Percy folio MS., of one of which Prof. Child gives the outline in his <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/englishscottishp12chilrich/page/288/mode/2up">English and Scottish Ballads, Boston (U.S.), 1884, Part ii.</a>, pp. 289, 290:</p>
<p>The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell</p>
<p>ARTHUR, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Sir</span> <span class="pre">Gromer</span> <span class="pre">occurs</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">&quot;The</span> <span class="pre">Turke</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Gowin,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">Percy</span> <span class="pre">MS.,</span> <span class="pre">Hales</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Furnivall,</span> <span class="pre">i.,</span> <span class="pre">102;</span> <span class="pre">Sir</span> <span class="pre">Grummore</span> <span class="pre">Grummorsum,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;a</span> <span class="pre">good</span> <span class="pre">knight</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Scotland,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Morte</span> <span class="pre">d'</span> <span class="pre">Arthur</span> <span class="pre">ed.</span> <span class="pre">Wright,</span> <span class="pre">i.,</span> <span class="pre">286,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">elsewhere.</span> <span class="pre">Madden.]</span></code> who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king’s bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but after a while he took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in different directions, put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should help at need.</p>
<p>Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady riding on a richly caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur, and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain’s wife. The king said this lay with Gawain; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. “No matter,” she rejoined, “though I be foul, choice for a mate hath an owl. “When thou comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost.”</p>
<p>The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man he saw was Gawain, who asked him how he had sped. Never so ill; he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. “Is that all?” said Gawain. “I will wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no friend.” Well might the king exclaim, “Of all knights thou bearest the flower!”</p>
<p>After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded her answer. “Some say this, and some say that, but above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[See</span> <span class="pre">Note</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">end</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">paper:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Women</span> <span class="pre">desire</span> <span class="pre">Sovereignty.&quot;]</span></code> tell this to the knight; he will curse her that told thee, for his labour is lost.” Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could. “Nay, nay, king,” said Grorner, “thou art but a dead man.” “Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell. I pray, I may see her burn on a fire.” And so they parted.</p>
<p>Dame Ragnell was also waiting for Arthur, and would hear of nothing but immediate fulfilment of her bargain. She followed the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person: she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats all that was set before her, less and more.</p>
<p>A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. “I will do more,” said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would not hold: he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul by day, or fair by day and foul by night. <code class="docutils literal

him that her step-dame had turned her into that monstrous shape by necromancy, not to recover her own till the best knight in England had wedded her and given her sovereignty in all points.</p>
<p>A charming little scene follows, in which Arthur visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the fiend may have slain him.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 This is the scene in the bridal chamber next morning:

<p>On this ballad, Sir F. Madden suggests, was founded that of the “Marriage of Sir Gawaine,” which Percy printed, supplying from conjecture the <em>lacunae</em>, in the first edition of his <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em>, 1765, and the two subsequent editions. It is thus given in the <em>Percy Folio MS.</em>, edited by Drs. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i., and reproduced by Prof. Child:</p>

A dissertation on romance and minstrelsy
by Ritson, Joseph, 1752-1803; Chrétien, de Troyes, 12th cent</p>
<p>Publication date 1891</p>
<p>p57-70</p>
<p>Several metrical romances, according to Bishop Percy’s account, are extant in his lordship’s celebrated folio manuscript, many of which are not to be now found in print; amongst these are the following:— <em>Sir Cauline</em>, <em>John the Reve</em>, <em>Guy and Colbronde</em>, <em>Libeaux Disconius</em> (a different copy from the one here printed), <em>King Arthur and the King of Cornwall</em>, <em>Sir Lionel</em>, <em>The Greene Knight</em>, <em>The Earl of Carlisle</em>, <em>Sir Lambwell</em>, <em>Merline</em>, <em>King Arthur’s Death</em>, <em>The Legend of King Arthur</em>, <em>The Legend of Sir Guy</em>, <em>Eger and Grime</em>, and many songs and ballads. The MS. (compiled by Thomas Blount, author of <em>The Law-Dictionary</em>, etc., about the middle of the seventeenth century), as we are told by the right reverend prelate, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">&quot;advertisement&quot;</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">signed</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Thomas</span> <span class="pre">Percy,</span> <span class="pre">fellow</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">St.</span> <span class="pre">John's</span> <span class="pre">College,</span> <span class="pre">Oxford,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">lordship's</span> <span class="pre">nephew,</span> <span class="pre">whom</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">late</span> <span class="pre">Mister</span> <span class="pre">Steevens</span> <span class="pre">assured</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">present</span> <span class="pre">editor</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">never</span> <span class="pre">seen</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">word</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">it.]</span></code> is a long narrow volume, containing igi sonnets, ballads, historical songs, and metrical romances, either in the whole or in part, for many of them are extremely mutilated and imperfect.</p>
<p>“The first and last leaves,” he says, “are wanting; and of 54 pages near the beginning half of every leaf hath been torn away, and several others are injured towards the end; besides that through a great part of the volume the top or bottom line, and sometimes both, have been cut off in the binding.” … The transcripts moreover “are sometimes extremely incorrect and faulty, being in such instances probably made from defective copies, or the imperfect recitation of illiterate fingers, so that a considerable portion of the song or narrative is sometimes omitted, and miserable trash or nonsense not unfrequently introduced into pieces of considerable merit:” the copyist, it seems, often growing “so weary of his labour as to write on without the least attention to the sense or meaning: so that the word which should form rhyme is found misplaced in the middle of the line; and we have such blunders as these, <em>want and will</em> for <em>wanton will</em>; even <em>pan and wale</em> for <em>wan and pale</em>, etc., etc.” Certainly this is a most extraordinary, as well as unfortunate, book, and the labour of the right reverend editor in correcting, refining, improving, completing, and enlarging the orthography, grammar, text, style, and supplying the chasms and hiatuses, <em>valdè deflenda!</em> must have equalled that of Hercules in cleansing the Augean stable: so that a parcel of old rags and tatters were thus ingeniously and haply converted into an elegant new suit.</p>
<p>The existence and authenticity of this famous MS. in its present mutilated and miserable condition is no longer to be denied or disputed; at the same time, it is a certain and positive fact, that, in the elegant and refined work it gave occasion to, there is scarcely one single poem, song, or ballad, fairly or honestly printed, either from the above fragment or other alleged authorities, from the beginning to the end; many pieces, also, being inserted, as ancient and authentic, which there is every reason to believe never existed before its publication. To correct the obvious errors of an illiterate transcriber, to supply irremediable defects, and to make sense of nonsense, are certainly essential duties of an editor of ancient poetry, provided he act with integrity and publicity; but secretly to suppress the original text, and insert his own fabrications for the sake of providing more refined entertainment for readers of taste and genius, is no proof of either judgment, candour, or integrity.</p>
<p>In what manner this ingenious editor conducted himself in this patched-up publication will be evident from the following parallel, which may be useful to future manufacturers in this line:—</p>
<p>The Marriage of Sir Gawaine. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">lines</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">words</span> <span class="pre">marked</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">elevated</span> <span class="pre">commas</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">substitutions</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">old</span> <span class="pre">readings.</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">whole</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">italics</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">own.]</span></code></p>

<p>O peace, O peace, thou gentle Gawaine,<br />

For he was stiffe and strong with all,<br />
His strokes were nothing sweete.</p>

I ought to him to pay,<br />
I must come againe as I am sworne,<br />

That he might keepe his day.</p>

<p>That looked soe foule and that was wont<br />
On the wild more to goe.</p>
<p>Come kisse her, brother Kay, then said sir Gawaine,<br />
And amend thee of thy life,<br />
I sware this is the same lady<br />
That I marryed to my wiffe.</p>
<p>Sir Kay kissed that lady bright,<br />
Standing upon his feete:<br />
He swore, as he was trew knight,<br />
The spice was never soe sweete.</p>
<p>Well, cozen Gawaine, saies sir Kay,<br />
Thy chance is fallen arright,<br />
For thou hast gotten one of the fairest maids,<br />
I ever saw with my sight.</p>
<p>It is my fortune, said sir Gawaine,<br />
For my unckle Arthurs sake:<br />
I am as glad as grasse wold be of raine,<br />
Great joy that I may take.</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine tooke the lady by the one arme,<br />
Sir Kay tooke her by the tother;<br />
They led her straight to King Arthur,<br />
As they were brother and brother.</p>
<p>King Arthur welcomed them there all,<br />
And soe did lady Genever his queene,<br />
With all the knights of the rounde table,<br />
Most seemly to be seene.</p>
<p>King Arthur beheld that lady faire,<br />
That was soe faire and bright,<br />
He thanked Christ in trinity<br />
For Sir Gawaine that gentle knight.</p>
<p>Soe did the knights, both more or lesse,<br />
Rejoyced all that day,<br />
For the good chance that hapened was<br />
To sir Gawaine and his lady gay.</p>
<p>This mode of publishing ancient poetry displays, it must be confessed, considerable talent and genius, but savours strongly, at the same time, of unfairness and dishonesty. Here are numerous stanzas inserted which are not in the original, and others omitted which are there. The purchasers and perusers of such a collection are deceived and imposed upon; the pleasure they receive is derived from the idea of antiquity, which, in fact, is perfect illusion.</p>
<p>If the ingenious editor had published all his imperfect poems by correcting the blunders of puerility or inattention, and supplying the defects of barbarian ignorance, with proper distinction of type (as, in one instance, he actually has done), it would not only have gratified the austerest antiquary, but also provided refined entertainment “for every reader of taste and genius.” He would have acted fairly and honorably, and given every sort of reader complete satisfaction. Authenticity would have been united with improvement, and all would have gone well; whereas, in the present editions, it is firmly believed, not one article has been ingeniously or faithfully printed from the beginning to the end; nor did the late eminent Thomas Tyrwhitt, so ardent a researcher into ancient poetry, and an intimate friend of the possessor, ever see this curious, though tattered, fragment, nor would the late excellent George Stevens, on the bishop’s personal application, consent to sanction the authenticity of the printed copy with his signature. <code class="docutils literal

<h1>Sir Gawain and His Marriage to Lady Ragnell<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-gawain-and-his-marriage-to-lady-ragnell" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This is one of the tales I remember hearing most frequently when we first started listening to storytellers, and it is one that I have a soft spot for.</p>
<p>The core of the tale is follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>King Arthur is out hunting and gets separated from his party;  he meets a knight who would challenge him, say Gawain has taken his lands from him. Arthur must give way, promising to return by the next New Year’s Day with the answer to the question “What is it that a woman desires the most?” else he will cut off his head. Arthur returns to court unhappily, sets out with Gawain for anwsers, but none of them seem satisfactory. On the way to meet the Lord, Arthur meets a hideous hag. She says she has the answer, but the price is that she weds Gawain. Arthur checks with Gawain, ho says he will do what he must for his King. She gives the answer to Arthur and he gives it to the Lord; and the Lord is angry - his sister must have told Arthur.</p>
<p>Back at court, the hag arrives, eats noisily, and goes off with Gawain. He is astonished to see she is beautiful; she says she is under an enchantment, and will he have her foul by day and fair by night, or v.v. He flounders, says it is her choice. She is released from the curse and the next morning the court is surprised to see Gawain with the fair maiden.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924072606613/page/n65/mode/2up"><em>The Legend of Sir Gawain; studies upon its original scope and significance</em></a>, 1897, p48, Jessie L. Weston summarises an 1839 version of the original metrical romance, by Frederic Madden in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>… In the fragmentary poem of the <em>The Marriage of Sir Gawayne</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Sir</span> <span class="pre">Gawayne,</span> <span class="pre">Madden,</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">288.]</span></code> we find the hero, in order to rescue King Arthur from the snares of a powerful enchanter, chivalrously wedding the magician’s sister, a lady of unexampled hideousness. On the marriage night she reveals herself as beautiful as she was previously repulsive, and gives her husband the choice whether he will have her beautiful by night, and hideous by day, or vice versa. Gawain, with that courtesy for which he was famous, leaves the decision to the lady; whereupon she tells him she has been laid under a spell to preserve this repulsive form till she finds a knight courteous enough ‘to give her her will.’ The spell is now broken, and she will be beautiful alike by night and by day.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A note in Percy’s 1794 edition of <em>Reliques</em> describes the state of fragmentation in the original manuscript.</p>

<p>with the poem p350-8</p>
<p>XIX.</p>
<p>THE ANCIENT FRAGMENT OF THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE.</p>
<p>The Second Poem in this Volume, intitled The Marriage of Sir Gawayne, having been offered to the Reader with large conjectural Supplements and Corrections, the old Fragment itself is here literally and exactiy printed from the Editor’s folio MS. with all its defects, inaccuracies, and errata; that ſuch auſtere Antiquaries, as complain that the ancient copies have not been always rigidly adhered to, may ſee how unfit for publication many of the pieces would have been if all the blunders, corruptions, and nonſenſe of illiterate Reciters and Tranſcribers had been ſuperſtitiouſly retained, without ſome attempt to correct and emend them.</p>
<p>This Ballad had moſt unfortunately ſuffered by having half of every leaf in this Part of the MS. torn away; and, as about Nine Stanzas’ generally occur in the half page now remaining, it is concluded, that the other half contained nearly the ſame number of Stanzas.</p>
</div>
<p>Structurally, the tale  poses a riddle — Sir Gromer Somer Joure’s challenge to Arthur — and then introduces several dilemmas (Arthur’s unwillingness to speak for Sir Gawain in committing him to marriage, Dame Ragnell’s question to Gawain), Dame Ragnell’s answer to the riddle — letting the other person decide — is also the answer that resolves the dilemmas.</p>
<p>Madden’s version is as follows:</p>

<p>p. lxvii</p>
<p>The Weddynge of S. Gawene and Dame Ragnelle. fol. 128°.</p>
<p>Printed in the present volume, Appendix, No. VIII. This is the identical poem referred to erroneously by Warton as existing in one of the Tanner MSS. (See Notes; p. 358.) For its discovery, (after the greater part of the sheets of this work was printed off,) I am indebted to the Rev. Henry O. Coxe, Assistant Librarian of the Bodleian Library, who most kindly and promptly undertook a transcript, which was subsequently compared by myself with the Manuscript. It is, unquestionably, the original of the mutilated poem in the Percy folio, and is sufficiently curious to render its insertion in the Appendix an object of interest, although, had I been earlier aware of its existence, some change would probably have been made in the arrangement. The title in the MS. is added by a later hand, and the poem itself is very carelessly written, so that several lines appear occasionally omitted. An entire page, containing — lines, is, unfortunately, wanting.</p>

<p>Frederic Madden <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bib_fict_2517737/page/298/mode/2up">Syr Gawayne; a collection of ancient romance-poems, by Scotish and English authors, relating to that celebrated knight of the Round Table, with an introduction, notes, and a glossary.</a>, 1839.</p>
<p>Notes pp.358-360</p>
<p>Marriage of Sir Gawaine.</p>
<p>THIS fragment is borrowed from the text of the Percy Manuscript, as given in the <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_reliques-of-ancient-engl_1794_3/page/350/mode/2up"><em>“Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,”</em> vol. iii. p. 350, edit. 1794</a>. Dr. Percy supplied the deficiencies in a very ingenious manner, and inserted the ballad thus amended in the first edition of his collection, 8vo, 1764, and repeated it in all subsequent impressions; but this mode of editing ancient poetry having justly been blamed by Ritson and Pinkerton, the Bishop in the fourth edition annexed the fragment, “with all its defects, inaccuracies and errata,” in order to show the state of the poem in the MS. Ritson reprinted the genuine and the <em>amended</em> texts in parallel columns in the Dissertation prefixed to his <em>Metrical Romances</em>, 8vo, 1802, p. cx, and the ballad in its improved form was introduced also by Lewis into his <em>Tales of Wonder</em>, vol. ii. p. 362, 8vo, 1802. The Bishop was of opinion that this poem was more ancient than the time of Chaucer, and that he borrowed from it his <em>Wife of Bathe’s tale</em> (See <em>Cambro-Briton</em>, vol. i. p. 256, 8vo, 1820); and Sir Walter Scott in a letter to George Ellis writes, that the tale of Sir Gawayne’s Foul Lady is originally Scaldic, as appears in the history of Hrolf Kraka, edited py Torfzeus, 12mo, Havn. 1715, cap. vii. (<em>Life</em>, by Lockhart, vol.i. p. 334.) The passage itself is quoted from the <em>Saga</em> by Scott in his <em>Border Minstrelsy</em>, vol. ii. p. 140, in illustration of the old Scotish ballad of King Henrie, which preserves very remarkably the legend of the Scandinavian monarch, Helgius.</p>
<p>Warton says in a note to his <em>“History of English Poetry,”</em> vol. ii. p. 41, ed. 1894, “I must not forget here, that Sir Gawaine, one of Arthur’s champions, is celebrated in a separate romance. Among Tanner’s Manuscripts we have <em>The Weddynge of Sir Gawaine</em>, Numb. 455, Bibl. Bodl. It begins, ‘Be ye blythe, and listeneth to the lyf of a lorde riche.’” It would have given me much pleasure to have included this romance in the present volume, but Warton’s reference is erroneous, and although the Rev. Dr. Bandinel with the greatest courtesy undertook a minute and laborious search for the poem in question, it was without success. Warton’s notorious inaccuracy in matters of this sort forms a sad blot in his otherwise very useful and entertaining work, of which a <em>critical</em> edition is still much desiderated.</p>

<p>P. 293, 1. 116. <em>Sir Lancelott and Sir Steven bold.</em></p>
<p>The name of the second of these champions does not occur in the Round Table romances.</p>
<p><em>Ibid.</em> 1. 120.<br />
<em>Soe did Sir Banier and Str Bore,</em><br />
<em>Sir Garrett with them, soe gay.</em></p>
<p><em>Banier</em> is probably a mistake for <em>Beduer</em>, the king’s constable. Sir <em>Bore</em> is Bors de Gauves. (See previous Note, p. 313.) Sir <em>Garett</em> is <em>Gareth</em> or <em>Gaheriet</em>, the younger brother of Sir Gawayne; and his adventures, under the surname of <em>Beaumayns</em>, occupy an entire book,—the seventh,—in the <em>Morte d’ Arthur</em>, vol. i. pp. 186-245. He took the part of Lancelot against his brothers, but was accidentally killed by him on the occasion of the rescue of queen Guenever. <em>Ibid.</em> vol. ii. p. 403. Revenge for his loss prompted Sir Gawayne to induce king Arthur to cross the sea to attack Lancelot, which ultimately proved the destruction of the whole of the <em>Table Ronde</em>. Sir Walter Scott in a Note on <em>Sir Tristrem</em>, p. 379, ed. 1833, quotes a “romance of Sir <em>Gaheret</em>,” in which the knight plays at chess with a beautiful fairy, [Floribelle, a <em>suivante</em> of the fairy Morgana, ] and is vanquished, but is afterwards liberated from his confinement by his cousin [brother] Gawayne, who wins the game by a move long afterwards called <em>l’échec de Gauvain</em>, and now <em>léchec du berger</em>, or fool’s-mate. In reality there is no such romance, but the adventure here alluded to occurs in an episodical tale of Gawayne and his three brothers, analysed in the <em>Bibliotheque des Romans, Juillet</em>, 1777, pp. 87-122. I may here venture to correct another venial error of Scott, who in the same work, p. 416, quotes from Gower the lines,</p>
<p>There was Tristrem, which was beloved<br />
With bele Isolde; and Lancelot<br />
Stode with Guenor, and <em>Galahote</em><br />
With his lady.</p>
<p>Sir Walter argues, that Gower is here incorrect, since <em>Galahaut</em> or <em>Galahad</em> had no paramour. But Gower is perfectly accurate, and alludes to <em>Gallehault</em>, king of the <em>loingtaines isles</em> or <em>de oultre les marches</em>, whose mistress was Malchault, lady in attendance on queen Guenever, and by whose instrumentality the intrigue of Lancelot with her mistress was brought about. See the <em>Roman de Lancelot</em>, vol. i. ff. lxxxiii-v, edit. 1513. Scott confounds this <em>Gallehault</em> with <em>Galaad</em>, the immaculate son of Lancelot, who accomplished the adventure of the Sangreal.</p>

<p>A version of the verse in a rather more modern form appeared in Percy’s <em>“Reliques of Ancient English Poetry”</em>, which was widely quoted elsewhere.</p>

<p>THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE.</p>

<p>PART I.</p>
<p>King Arthur lives in merry Carleile,<br />
And seemely is to see;<br />
And there with him Queene Guenever,<br />
That bride soe bright of blee.</p>
<p>And there with him Queene Guenever,<br />
That bride so bright in bowre:<br />
And all his barons about him stoode,<br />
That were both stiffe and stowre.</p>
<p>The King a royale Christmasse kept,<br />
With mirth and princelye cheare;<br />
To him repaired many a knighte,<br />
That came both farre and neare.</p>
<p>And when they were to dinner sette,<br />
And cups went freely round;<br />
Before them came a faire damselle,<br />
And knelt upon the ground.</p>

“As lyttle shold him spare;<br />
“Goe tell, say’d hee, that cuckold kinge,<br />

<p>On magicke grounde that castle stoode,<br />

<p>Forth then rush’d that carlish Knight,<br />
King Arthure felte the charme:<br />
His sturdy sinewes lost their strengthe,<br />
Downe sunke his. feeble arme.</p>

“He have noe other hyre.” —</p>
<p>King Arthur then helde up his hande,<br />
And sware upon his faye,<br />
Then took his leave of the grimme Barone<br />
And faste hee rode awaye.</p>
<p>And he rode east, and he rode west,<br />
And did of all inquyre,<br />
What thing it is all women crave,<br />
And what they most desyre.</p>
<p>Some told him riches, pompe, or state;<br />
Some rayment fine and brighte;<br />
Some told him mirthe; some flatterye;<br />
And some a jollye knighte.</p>
<p>In letters all King Arthur wrote,<br />
And seal’d them with his ringe:<br />
But still his minde was helde in doubte,<br />
Each tolde a different thinge.</p>
<p>As ruthfulle he lode over a more,<br />
He saw a Ladye sette<br />

Her chin stoode all awrye;<br />
And where as sholde have been her mouthe,<br />
Lo! there was set her eye;</p>
<p>Her haires, like serpents, clung aboute<br />
Her cheekes of deadlye hewe:<br />
A worse-form’d ladye than she was,<br />
No man mote ever viewe.</p>
<p>To hail the King in seemelye sorte<br />
This ladye was fulle faine;<br />
But King Arthure all sore amaz’d,<br />
No aunswere made againe.</p>
<p>— “What wight art thou,” the Ladye say’d,<br />
“That wilt not speake to mee;<br />
“Sir, I may chance to ease thy paine,<br />

“Therefore be merrye and lighte”—</p>
<p>— “Nowe naye, nowe naye, good Sir Gawaine;<br />

“To cover our intent;<br />
“And wee’ll away to the greene forest,<br />
“As wee a hunting went—</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot, Sir Stephen bolde,<br />
They rode with them that daye;<br />
And foremoste of the companye<br />
There rode the stewarde Kaye:</p>
<p>Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,<br />
And eke Sir Garratte keene;<br />
Sir Tristram too, that gentle knight,<br />
To the forest freshe and greene.</p>
<p>And when they came to the greene forrest,<br />
Beneathe a faire holley tree,<br />
There sate that Ladye in red scarlette<br />
That unseemelye was to see.</p>
<p>Sir Kay beheld that Lady’s face,<br />
And looked upon her sweere;<br />
— “Whoever kisses that Ladye,” he sayes,<br />
“Of his kisse he stands in feare.” —</p>
<p>Sir Kay beheld that Ladye againe,<br />
And looked upon her snout;<br />
— “Whoever kisses that Ladye,” he sayes,<br />
“Of his kisse he stands in doubt” —</p>
<p>— “Peace, brother Kay,” sayde Sir Gawaine,<br />
“And amend thee of thy life;<br />
“For there is a Knight amongst us all,<br />
“Must marry her to his wife,”-—</p>
<p>— “What, marry this foule queane,” quoth Kay,<br />
“I’ the devils name anone;<br />
“Gett mee a wife wherever I maye,<br />
“In sooth shee shall be none,”—</p>
<p>Then some tooke up their hawkes in haste,<br />
And some tooke up their houndes;<br />
And sayd they wolde not many her,<br />
For cities, nor for townes.</p>
<p>Then bespake him King Arthure,<br />
And sware there by this daye;<br />
—“For a little foule sighte and mislikinge,<br />
“Yee shall not say her naye.” —</p>
<p>— “Peace, Lordings, peace;” Sir Gawaine sayd;<br />
“Nor make debate and strife;<br />
“This lothlye Ladye I will take,<br />
“And marry her to my wife”—</p>
<p>-— “Nowe thankes, nowe thankes, good Sir Gawaine,<br />
“And a blessinge be thy meede!<br />
“For as I am thine owne ladye,<br />
“Thou never shalt rue this deede.” —</p>
<p>Then up they took that lothly Dame,<br />
And home anone they bringe:<br />
And there Sir Gawaine he her wed,<br />
And married her with a ringe.</p>
<p>And when they were in wed-bed laid,<br />
And all were done awaye:<br />
— “Come turne to mee, mine owne wed-lord,<br />
“Come turne to mee I praye.” —</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine scant could lift his head,<br />
For sorrowe and for care;<br />
When, lo I instead of (hat lothelye Dame,<br />
Hee sawe a young Ladye faire.</p>
<p>Sweet blushes stayned her rud-red cheeke,<br />
Her eyen were blacke as sloe:<br />
The ripening cherrye swellde her lippe,<br />
And all her necke was snowe.</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine kiss’d that Lady faire,<br />
Lying upon the sheete:<br />
And swore, as he was a true Knighte,<br />
The spice was never soe sweete.</p>
<p>Sir Gawaine kiss’d that Lady brighter<br />
Lying there by his side:<br />
— “The fairest flower is not soe faire:<br />
“Thou never can st bee my bride.”—</p>
<p>— “I am thy bride, mine owne deare Lorde,<br />
“The same whiche thou didst knowe,<br />
“That was soe lothlye, and was wont<br />

<p>“Nowe, gentle Gawaine, chuse,” quoth shee,<br />
“And make thy choice with care;<br />
“Whether by night, or else by daye,<br />
“Shall I be foule or faire?” —</p>
<p>— “To have thee foule still in the night,<br />

“I had rather farre, my lady deare,<br />

<p>— “What, when gaye ladyes goe with their lordes<br />
“To drinke the ale and wine;<br />
“Alas I then I must hide myself,<br />
“I must not goe with mine?”—</p>
<p>— “My faire ladye,” Sir Gawaine sayd,<br />
“I yield me to thy skille;<br />
“Because thou art mine owne ladye<br />
“Thou shalt have all thy wille.” —</p>
<p>— “Nowe blessed be thou, sweete Gawaine,<br />
“And the daye that I thee see;<br />
“For as thou seest mee at this time,<br />

<p>“My father was an aged knighte,<br />
“And yet it chanced soe,<br />
“He tooke to wife a false ladye,<br />

“Until he wolde yielde to be ruled by mee,<br />
“And let mee have all my wille.</p>
<p>“She witchd my brother to a carlish boore,<br />
“And made him stiffe and stronge:<br />
“And built him a bowre on magicke grounde,<br />
“To live by rapine and wronge.</p>
<p>“But now the spelle is broken throughe,<br />
“And wronge is turnde to righte;<br />
“Henceforth I shall be a faire ladye,<br />
“And hee be a gentle knighte,”—</p>

<p>As to the tale itself, Brock and Coulston focus on the “loathely lady” motif, and the extent to which Gawaine and Dame Ragnell is a parallel of Chaucer’s “The Wife of Bath”.</p>

<p>Judging from the number of versions still extant, this curious tale must have been a great favourite during the middle ages, when it was so much the fashion to decry women and example-books of their profligacy and trickery were rife. The story is the subject of two long ballads in the Percy folio MS., of one of which Prof. Child gives the outline in his <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/englishscottishp12chilrich/page/288/mode/2up">English and Scottish Ballads, Boston (U.S.), 1884, Part ii.</a>, pp. 289, 290:</p>
<p>The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell</p>
<p>ARTHUR, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Sir</span> <span class="pre">Gromer</span> <span class="pre">occurs</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">&quot;The</span> <span class="pre">Turke</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Gowin,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">Percy</span> <span class="pre">MS.,</span> <span class="pre">Hales</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Furnivall,</span> <span class="pre">i.,</span> <span class="pre">102;</span> <span class="pre">Sir</span> <span class="pre">Grummore</span> <span class="pre">Grummorsum,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;a</span> <span class="pre">good</span> <span class="pre">knight</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Scotland,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Morte</span> <span class="pre">d'</span> <span class="pre">Arthur</span> <span class="pre">ed.</span> <span class="pre">Wright,</span> <span class="pre">i.,</span> <span class="pre">286,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">elsewhere.</span> <span class="pre">Madden.]</span></code> who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king’s bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but after a while he took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in different directions, put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should help at need.</p>
<p>Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady riding on a richly caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur, and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain’s wife. The king said this lay with Gawain; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. “No matter,” she rejoined, “though I be foul, choice for a mate hath an owl. “When thou comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost.”</p>
<p>The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man he saw was Gawain, who asked him how he had sped. Never so ill; he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. “Is that all?” said Gawain. “I will wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no friend.” Well might the king exclaim, “Of all knights thou bearest the flower!”</p>
<p>After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded her answer. “Some say this, and some say that, but above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[See</span> <span class="pre">Note</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">end</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">paper:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Women</span> <span class="pre">desire</span> <span class="pre">Sovereignty.&quot;]</span></code> tell this to the knight; he will curse her that told thee, for his labour is lost.” Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could. “Nay, nay, king,” said Grorner, “thou art but a dead man.” “Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell. I pray, I may see her burn on a fire.” And so they parted.</p>
<p>Dame Ragnell was also waiting for Arthur, and would hear of nothing but immediate fulfilment of her bargain. She followed the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person: she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats all that was set before her, less and more.</p>
<p>A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. “I will do more,” said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever saw.

<p>On this ballad, Sir F. Madden suggests, was founded that of the “Marriage of Sir Gawaine,” which Percy printed, supplying from conjecture the <em>lacunae</em>, in the first edition of his <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em>, 1765, and the two subsequent editions. It is thus given in the <em>Percy Folio MS.</em>, edited by Drs. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i., and reproduced by Prof. Child:</p>

A dissertation on romance and minstrelsy
by Ritson, Joseph, 1752-1803; Chrétien, de Troyes, 12th cent</p>
<p>Publication date 1891</p>
<p>p57-70</p>
<p>Several metrical romances, according to Bishop Percy’s account, are extant in his lordship’s celebrated folio manuscript, many of which are not to be now found in print; amongst these are the following:— <em>Sir Cauline</em>, <em>John the Reve</em>, <em>Guy and Colbronde</em>, <em>Libeaux Disconius</em> (a different copy from the one here printed), <em>King Arthur and the King of Cornwall</em>, <em>Sir Lionel</em>, <em>The Greene Knight</em>, <em>The Earl of Carlisle</em>, <em>Sir Lambwell</em>, <em>Merline</em>, <em>King Arthur’s Death</em>, <em>The Legend of King Arthur</em>, <em>The Legend of Sir Guy</em>, <em>Eger and Grime</em>, and many songs and ballads. The MS. (compiled by Thomas Blount, author of <em>The Law-Dictionary</em>, etc., about the middle of the seventeenth century), as we are told by the right reverend prelate, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">&quot;advertisement&quot;</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">signed</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Thomas</span> <span class="pre">Percy,</span> <span class="pre">fellow</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">St.</span> <span class="pre">John's</span> <span class="pre">College,</span> <span class="pre">Oxford,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">lordship's</span> <span class="pre">nephew,</span> <span class="pre">whom</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">late</span> <span class="pre">Mister</span> <span class="pre">Steevens</span> <span class="pre">assured</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">present</span> <span class="pre">editor</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">never</span> <span class="pre">seen</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">word</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">it.]</span></code> is a long narrow volume, containing igi sonnets, ballads, historical songs, and metrical romances, either in the whole or in part, for many of them are extremely mutilated and imperfect.</p>
<p>“The first and last leaves,” he says, “are wanting; and of 54 pages near the beginning half of every leaf hath been torn away, and several others are injured towards the end; besides that through a great part of the volume the top or bottom line, and sometimes both, have been cut off in the binding.” … The transcripts moreover “are sometimes extremely incorrect and faulty, being in such instances probably made from defective copies, or the imperfect recitation of illiterate fingers, so that a considerable portion of the song or narrative is sometimes omitted, and miserable trash or nonsense not unfrequently introduced into pieces of considerable merit:” the copyist, it seems, often growing “so weary of his labour as to write on without the least attention to the sense or meaning: so that the word which should form rhyme is found misplaced in the middle of the line; and we have such blunders as these, <em>want and will</em> for <em>wanton will</em>; even <em>pan and wale</em> for <em>wan and pale</em>, etc., etc.” Certainly this is a most extraordinary, as well as unfortunate, book, and the labour of the right reverend editor in correcting, refining, improving, completing, and enlarging the orthography, grammar, text, style, and supplying the chasms and hiatuses, <em>valdè deflenda!</em> must have equalled that of Hercules in cleansing the Augean stable: so that a parcel of old rags and tatters were thus ingeniously and haply converted into an elegant new suit.</p>
<p>The existence and authenticity of this famous MS. in its present mutilated and miserable condition is no longer to be denied or disputed; at the same time, it is a certain and positive fact, that, in the elegant and refined work it gave occasion to, there is scarcely one single poem, song, or ballad, fairly or honestly printed, either from the above fragment or other alleged authorities, from the beginning to the end; many pieces, also, being inserted, as ancient and authentic, which there is every reason to believe never existed before its publication. To correct the obvious errors of an illiterate transcriber, to supply irremediable defects, and to make sense of nonsense, are certainly essential duties of an editor of ancient poetry, provided he act with integrity and publicity; but secretly to suppress the original text, and insert his own fabrications for the sake of providing more refined entertainment for readers of taste and genius, is no proof of either judgment, candour, or integrity.</p>
<p>In what manner this ingenious editor conducted himself in this patched-up publication will be evident from the following parallel, which may be useful to future manufacturers in this line:—</p>
<p>The Marriage of Sir Gawaine. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">lines</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">words</span> <span class="pre">marked</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">elevated</span> <span class="pre">commas</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">substitutions</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">old</span> <span class="pre">readings.</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">whole</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">italics</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">own.]</span></code></p>

<p>This mode of publishing ancient poetry displays, it must be confessed, considerable talent and genius, but savours strongly, at the same time, of unfairness and dishonesty. Here are numerous stanzas inserted which are not in the original, and others omitted which are there. The purchasers and perusers of such a collection are deceived and imposed upon; the pleasure they receive is derived from the idea of antiquity, which, in fact, is perfect illusion.</p>
<p>If the ingenious editor had published all his imperfect poems by correcting the blunders of puerility or inattention, and supplying the defects of barbarian ignorance, with proper distinction of type (as, in one instance, he actually has done), it would not only have gratified the austerest antiquary, but also provided refined entertainment “for every reader of taste and genius.” He would have acted fairly and honorably, and given every sort of reader complete satisfaction. Authenticity would have been united with improvement, and all would have gone well; whereas, in the present editions, it is firmly believed, not one article has been ingeniously or faithfully printed from the beginning to the end; nor did the late eminent Thomas Tyrwhitt, so ardent a researcher into ancient poetry, and an intimate friend of the possessor, ever see this curious, though tattered, fragment, nor would the late excellent George Stevens, on the bishop’s personal application, consent to sanction the authenticity of the printed copy with his signature. <code class="docutils literal

<h2>The Wife of Bath’s Tale<a class="headerlink" href="#the-wife-of-bath-s-tale" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Chaucer’s <em>The Wife of Bath’s Tale</em> differs in a couple of respects to the metrical romance, and is the version I have heard told most recently, and independently, by female tellers (Debs Newbold and Holly Medland), firstly from a female / feminst perspective, and secondly, as a frame tale.</p>
<p>The first major difference comes in the setting: the challenge is not set to King to Arthur, but is rather placed upon a knight found guilty of a brutal rape. He is saved from a punishment of death by Guinevere, who sets him the challenge of finding, within a year and a day, what it is that women desire the most; she should then decide his fate depneding on his answer.</p>
<p>The second difference is in the partial use of the tale as a frame tale, in which the first part of the tale of King Midas, taken from Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, is provided as an example of women’s appraently inability to keep a secret, albeit whilst still attempting to maintain a confidence.</p>

<p>THE DESIRE of Woman:<br />
OR THE Wife of BATH’s TALE.</p>
<p>By Mr. DRYDEN.</p>
<p>IN Days of Old, when <em>Arthur</em> fill’d the Throne,<br />
Whoſe Acts and Fame to Foreign Lands were blown;<br />
The little Elfs and little Fairy Queen<br />
Gambol’d on Heaths, and dane’d along the Green:<br />
And where the jolly Troop had led the Round,<br />
The Graſs untrodden roſe, and mark’d the Ground:<br />
Nor darkling did they glance, the Silver Light<br />
Of <em>Phoebe</em> ſerv’d to guide their Steps aright,<br />
And, with their Tripping pleas’d, prolong the Night.<br />
Her Beams they follow’d, where at full they play’d,<br />
Nor longer than ſhe ſhed her Horns they ftay’d:<br />
From thence with airy Flight to Foreign Lands convey’d<br />
Above the reſt, our <em>Britain</em> held they dear,<br />
More ſolemnly they kept their Sabbaths here,<br />
And made more ſpacious Rings, and revel’d half the Year.</p>
<p>I ſpeak of ancient Times; for now the Swain<br />
Returning late may paſs the Woods in vain,<br />
And never hope to ſee the nightly Train;<br />
In vain the Dairy now with Mints is dreſt,<br />
The Dairy-Maid expects no Fairy-Gueſt<br />
To skim the Bowls, and after pay the Feaſt.<br />
She ſighs, and ſhakes her empty Shoes in vain,<br />
No Silver-Penny to reward her Pain:<br />
For Priefts with Pray’rs, and other Godly Geer,<br />
Have made the merry Goblins diſappear;<br />
And where they play’d their merry Pranks before,<br />
Have ſprinkled Holy Water on the Floor:<br />
And Fry’r, that thro’ the wealthy Regions run<br />
Thick as the Motes that twinkle in the Sun,<br />
Reſort to Farmers rich, and bleſs their Halls;<br />
And exorciſe the Beds, and croſs the Walls:<br />
This makes the Fairy Choirs forſake the Place,<br />
When once ‘tis hallow’d with the Rites of Grace:<br />
But in the Walks where wicked Elves have been,<br />
The Learning of the Pariſh now is ſeen,<br />
The Midnight Parſon poſting o’er the Green,<br />
With Gown tuck’d up to Wakes; for <em>Sunday</em> next,<br />
With humming Ale encouraging his Text;<br />
Nor wants the holy Leer to Country-Girl betwixt.<br />
From Fiends and Imps he ſets the Village free,<br />
There haunts not any <em>Incubus</em> but He.<br />
The Maids and Women need no Danger fear<br />
To walk by Night, and Sanctity ſo near:<br />
For by ſome Hay-cock, or ſome ſhady Thorn,<br />
He bids his Beads both Even-ſong and Morn.</p>
<p>It ſo befel in this King <em>Arthur</em>’s Reign,<br />
A luſty Knight was pricking o’er the Plain;<br />
A Batchelor he was, and of the Courtly Train,<br />
It happen’d as he rode, a Damſel gay<br />
In Ruſſet Robes to Market took her Way;<br />
Soon on the Girl he caſt an am’rous Eye,<br />
So ſtraight ſhe walk’d, and on her Paſterns high:<br />
If ſeeing her behind he lik’d her Pace,<br />
Now turning ſhort, he better lik’d her Face:<br />
He ‘lights in haſte, and, full of youthful Fire,<br />
By Force accompliſh’d his obſcene Defire:<br />
This done, away he rode, not uneſpy’d;<br />
For ſwarming at his Back the Country cry’d;<br />
And, once in View, they never loſt the Sight,<br />
But ſeiz’d, and pinion’d brought to Court the Knight.</p>
<p>Then Courts of Kings were held in high Renown,<br />
E’re made the common Brothels of the Town:<br />
There, Virgins honourable Vows receiv’d,<br />
But chaſte as Maids in Monaſteries liv’d:<br />
The King himſelf, to nuptial Ties a Slave,<br />
No bad Example to his Poets gave:<br />
And they not bad, but in a vicious Age,<br />
Had not, to pleaſe the Prince, debauch’d the Stage.</p>
<p>Now what ſhould <em>Arthur</em> do? He lov’d the Knight;<br />
But Sov’reign Monarchs are the Source of Right:<br />
Mov’d by the Damſel’s Tears and common Cry,<br />
He doom’d the brutal Raviſher to die.<br />
But fair <em>Geneura</em> roſe in his Defence,<br />
And pray’d ſo hard for Mercy from the Prince,<br />
That to his Queen the King th’ Offender gave,<br />
And left it in her Pow’r to Kill or Save.<br />
This gracious Act the Ladies all approve,<br />
Who thought it much, a Man ſhould die for Love;<br />
And with their Miſtreſs join’d in cloſe Debate,<br />
(Cov’ring their Kindneſs with diſſembled Hate,)<br />
If not to free him, to prolong his Fate.<br />
At laſt agreed, they call’d him by Conſent<br />
Before the Queen and Female Parliament:<br />
And the fair Speaker riſing from her Chair,<br />
Did thus the Judgment of the Houſe declare:</p>
<p>‘Sir Knight, tho’ I have ask’d thy Life, yet ſtill<br />
‘Thy Deſtiny depends upon my Will:<br />
‘Nor haſt thou other Surety than the Grace<br />
‘Not due to thee from our offended Race.<br />
‘But as our Kind is of a ſofter Mold,<br />
‘And cannot Blood without a Sigh behold,<br />
‘I grant thee Life; reſerving ſtill the Pow’r<br />
‘To take the Forfeit when I ſee my Hour:<br />
‘Unleſs thy Anſwer to my next Demand<br />
‘Shall ſet Thee free from our avenging Hand:<br />
‘The Queſtion, whoſe Solution I require,<br />
‘Is, <em>What the Sex of Women moſt defire?</em><br />
‘In this Diſpute thy Judges are at Strife:<br />
‘Beware; for on thy Wit depends thy Life,<br />
‘Yet (leſt ſurpriz’d, unknowing what to ſay,<br />
‘Thou damn thy ſelf) we give thee farther Day:<br />
‘A Year is thine, to wander at thy Will,<br />
‘And learn from others, if thou want’ſt the Skill,<br />
‘But, not to hold our Proffer turn’d in Scorn,<br />
‘Good Sureties will we have for thy Return;<br />
‘That at the Time prefix’d thou ſhalt obey,<br />
‘And at thy Pledges Peril keep thy Day.’</p>
<p>Woe was the Knight at this ſevere Cemmand!<br />
But well he knew ‘twas bootleſs to withſtand:<br />
The Terms accepted, as the Fair ordain,<br />
He put in Bail for his Return again;<br />
And promis’d Anſwer at the Day aſſign’d,<br />
The beſt, with Heav’n’s Aſſiſtance, he could find.</p>
<p>His Leave thus taken, on his Way he went<br />
With heavy Heart, and full of Diſcontent,<br />
Miſdoubting much, and fearful of th’ Event.<br />
T’was hard the Truth of ſuch a Point to find,<br />
As was not yet agreed among the Kind.<br />
Thus on he went; ſtill anxious more and more,<br />
Ask’d all he met, and knock’d at ev’ry Door;<br />
Enquir’d of Men; but made his chief Requeſt<br />
To learn from Women what they lov’d the beſt.<br />
They anſwer’d each according to her Mind,<br />
To pleaſe herſelf, not all the Female Kind.<br />
One was for Wealth, another was for Place:<br />
Crones, old and ugly, wiſh’d a better Face,<br />
The Widow’s Wiſh was, oftentimes to wed<br />
The wanton Maids were all for Sport a-Bed.<br />
Some ſaid, the Sex were pleas’d with handſome Lies,<br />
And ſome groſs Flattry lov’d without Diſguiſe:<br />
Truth is, ſays one, he ſeldom fails to win,<br />
Who flatters well; for that’s our darling Sin.<br />
But long Attendance, and a duteous Mind,<br />
Will work ev’n with the Wiſeſt of our Kind.<br />
One thought the Sexes prime Felicity<br />
Was from the Bonds of Wedlock to be free:<br />
Their Pleaſures, Hours, and Actions all their own,<br />
And uncontrolbd to give Account to none.<br />
Some wiſh a Husband-Fool; but ſuch are curſt,<br />
For Fools perverſe, of Husbands are the worſt:<br />
All Women would be counted Chaſte and Wiſe;<br />
Nor ſhould our Spouſes ſee, but with our Eyes:<br />
For Fools will prate; and tho’ they want the Wit<br />
To find cloſe Faults, yet open Blots will hit:<br />
Tho’ better for their Eaſe to hold their Tongue,<br />
For Womankind was never in the Wrong.<br />
So Noiſe enſues, and Quarrels laſt for Life;<br />
The Wife abhors the Fool, the Fool the Wife.<br />
And ſome Men ſay, that great Delight have we<br />
To be for Truth extoll’d, and Secrecy;<br />
And conſtant in one Purpoſe ſtill to dwell,<br />
And not our Husband’s Counſels to reveal.<br />
But that’s a Fable; for our Sex is frail,<br />
Inventing rather than not tell a Tale.<br />
Like leaky Sieves, no Secrets we can hold:<br />
Witneſs the famous Tale that <em>Ovid</em> told.</p>
<p><em>Midas</em> the King, as in his Book appears,<br />
By <em>Phoebus</em> was endow’d with Aſſes Ears,<br />
Which under his long Locks he well conceal’d,<br />
(As Monarchs Vices muſt not be reveal’d)<br />
For fear the People have ‘em in the Wind,<br />
Who long ago were neither Dumb nor Blind;<br />
Nor apt to think from Heav’n their Title ſprings,<br />
Since <em>Jove</em> and <em>Mars</em> left of begetting Kings:<br />
This <em>Midas</em> knew; and durſt communicate<br />
To none but to his Wife, his Ears of State.<br />
One muſt be truſted, and he thought her fit,<br />
As paſſing prudent, and a parlous Wit.<br />
To this ſagacious Confeſſor he went,<br />
And told her what a Gift the Gods had ſent;<br />
But told it under Matrimonial Seal,<br />
With ſtrict Injunction never to reveal.<br />
The Secret heard, ſhe plighted him her Troth<br />
(And ſacred, ſure, is ev’ry Woman’s Oath)<br />
The Royal Malady ſhould reſt unknown,<br />
Both for her Husband’s Honour and her own.<br />
But ne’ertheleſs ſhe pin’d with Diſcontent;<br />
The Counſel rumbled till it found a Vent.<br />
The Thing, ſhe knew, ſhe was oblig’d to hide;<br />
By Int’reſt and by Oath the Wife was ty’d;<br />
But if ſhe told it not, the Woman dy’d.<br />
Loth to betray a Husband and a Prince,<br />
But ſhe muſt burſt, or blab; and no Pretence<br />
Of Honour ty’d her Tongue from Self-Defence.<br />
A marſhy Ground commodiouſly was near;<br />
Thither ſhe ran, and held her Breath for fear,<br />
Leſt if a Word ſhe ſpoke of any thing,<br />
That Word might be the Secret of the King.<br />
Thus, full of Counſel, to the Fen ſhe went,<br />
Grip’d all the Way, and longing for a Vent:<br />
Arriv’d by pure Neceſſity compell’d,<br />
On her majeſtic Marrow-bones ſhe kneel’d;<br />
Then to the Waters-brink ſhe laid her Head,<br />
And, as a <em>Bittour</em> bumps within a Reed,<br />
‘To thee alone, O Lake, ſhe ſaid, I tell<br />
‘(And, as thy Queen, command thee to concea)<br />
‘Beneath his Locks the King my Husband wears<br />
‘A goodly Royal Pair of Aſſes Ears.<br />
‘Now I have eas’d my Boſom of the Pain,<br />
Till the next longing Fit returns again!’</p>
<p>Thus thro’ a Woman was the Secret known;<br />
Tell us, and in Effect you tell the Town.<br />
But, to my Tale: The Knight with heavy Cheer,<br />
Wandring in vain, had now conſum’d the Year:<br />
One Day was only left to ſolve the Doubt;<br />
Yet knew no more than when he firſt ſet out.<br />
But home he muſt; and as th’Award had been,<br />
Yield up his Body Captive to the Queen.<br />
In this deſpairing State he happ’d to ride,<br />
As Fortune led him, by a Foreft-ſide:<br />
Lonely the Vale, and full of Horror-ſtood,<br />
Brown with the Shade of a religious Wood:<br />
When full before him, at the Noon of Night,<br />
(The Moon was up, and ſhot gleamy Light)<br />
He ſaw a Choir of Ladies in a Round;<br />
That featly footing ſeem’d to skim the Ground:<br />
Thus dancing Hand in Hand, ſo light they were,<br />
He knew not where they trod, on Earth or Air.<br />
At ſpeed he drove, and came a ſudden Gueſt,<br />
In hope where many Women were, at leaſt<br />
Some one by chance might anſwer his Requeſt.<br />
But faſter than his Horſe the Ladies flew,<br />
And in a trice were vaniſh’d out of View.</p>
<p>One only Hag remain’d; but fouler far<br />
Than Grandame Apes in <em>Indian</em> Foreſts are<br />
Againſt a wither’d Oak ſhe lean’d her Weight,<br />
Propp’d on her truſty Staff, not half upright,<br />
And dropp’d an aukward Court’ſy to the Knight.<br />
Then ſaid, ‘What makes you, Sir, ſo late abroad<br />
‘Without a Guide, and this no beaten Road?<br />
‘Or want you aught that here you hope to find,<br />
‘Or travel for ſome Trouble in your Mind?<br />
‘The laſt I gueſs; and, if I read aright,<br />
‘Thoſe of our Sex are bound to ſerve a Knight:<br />
‘Perhaps good Counſel may your Grief aſſuage;<br />
‘Then tell your Pain: For Wiſdom is in Age.’</p>
<p>To this the Knight: ‘Good Mother, would you know<br />
‘The ſecret Cauſe and Spring of all my Woe?<br />
‘My Life muſt with, To-morrow’s Light expire,<br />
‘Unleſs I tell <em>what Women moſt deſire</em>.<br />
‘Now, could you help me at this hard Eſſay,<br />
‘Or for your inborn Goodneſs, or for Pay;<br />
‘Yours is my Life, redeem’d by your Advice,<br />
‘Ask what you pleaſe, and I will pay the Price:<br />
‘The proudeſt Kerchief of the Court ſhall reſt<br />
‘Well ſatisfy’d of what they love the beſt.’<br />
‘Plight me thy Faith, quoth ſhe, that what I ask,<br />
‘Thy Danger over, and perform’d the Task;<br />
‘That ſhalt thou give for Hire of thy Demand;<br />
‘Here, take thy Oath, and ſeal it on my Hand;<br />
‘I warrant thee, on Peril of my Life,<br />
‘Thy Word ſhall pleaſe both Widow, Maid, and Wife’.</p>
<p>More Words there needed not to move the Knight<br />
To take her Offer, and his Truth to plight,<br />
With that ſhe ſpread her Mantle on the Ground,<br />
And, firſt enquiring whither he was bound,<br />
Bid him not fear, tho’ long and rough the Way,<br />
At Court he ſhould arrive e’re Break of Day:<br />
His Horſe ſhould find the Way without a Guide,<br />
She ſaid: With Fury they began to ride,<br />
He on the midſt, the Beldam at his Side.<br />
The Horſe, what Devil drove I cannot tell;<br />
But only this, they ſped their Journey well:<br />
And all the Way the Crone inform’d the Knihht,<br />
How he ſhould anſwer the Demand aright.</p>
<p>To Court they came: The News was quickly ſpread,<br />
Of his returning to redeem his Head.<br />
The Female Senate was aſſembled ſoon,<br />
With all the Mob of Women in the Town:<br />
The Queen ſate Lord Chief Juſtice of the Hall,<br />
And bade the Crier cite the Criminal,<br />
The Knight appear’d, and Silence they proclaim, .<br />
Then firſt the <em>Culprit</em> anſwer’d to his Name:<br />
And, after Forms of Law, was laſt requir’d<br />
To name the Thing that Women moſt deſir’d.</p>
<p>Th’Offender, taught his Leſſon by the Way,<br />
And by his Counſel order’d what to ſay,<br />
Thus bold began: ‘My Lady Liege (ſaid he)<br />
‘What all your Sex deſire, is <em>Sov’reignty</em>.<br />
‘The Wife affects her Husband to command;<br />
‘All muſt be hers, both Money, Houſe and Land.<br />
‘The Maids are Miſtreſſes ev’n in their Name;<br />
‘And of their Servants full Dominion claim.<br />
‘This, at the Peril of my Head, I ſay,<br />
‘A blunt plain Truth, The Sex aſpires to Sway,<br />
‘You to rule all, while we, like Slaves, obey.’</p>
<p>TO DO</p>
<p>There was not one, or Widow, Maid, or Wiſe,<br />
But ſaid, the Knight had well deſerv’d his Life.<br />
Ev’n fair Geneura, with a Bluſh, confeſs’d<br />
The Man had found what Women love the beſt.</p>
<p>Up ſtarts the Beldam, who was there unſeen,<br />
And, Rev’rence made, accoſted thus the Queen:<br />
‘My Liege, ſaid ſhe, before the Court ariſe,<br />
‘May I, poor Wretch, find Favour in your Eyes.<br />
‘To grant my juſt Requeſt? T’was I who taught<br />
‘The Knight this Anſwer, and inſpir’d his Thought.<br />
‘None but a Woman could a Man direct<br />
‘To tell us Women, what we moſt affect.<br />
‘But firſt I ſwore him on his Knightly Troth,<br />
‘(And here demand Performance of his Oath)<br />
‘To grant the Boon that next I ſhould defire:<br />
‘He gave his Faith, and I expect my Hire:<br />
My Promiſe is fulfill’d: I ſav’d his Life,<br />
‘And claim his Debt, to take me for his Wife.’<br />
The Knight was ask’d, nor could his Oath deny,<br />
But hop’d they would not force him to comply.<br />
The Women, who would rather wreſt the Laws,<br />
Than let a Siſter-Plaintiff loſe the Cauſe,<br />
(As Judges on the Bench more gracious are,<br />
And more attent to Brothers of the. Bar)<br />
Cry’d one and all, the Suppliant ſhould have Right,<br />
And to the Grandame-Hag adjudg’d the Knight.</p>
<p>In vain he ſigh’d, and oft’ with Tears deſird<br />
Some reaſonable Sute might be requir’d.<br />
But ſtill the Crone was conſtant to her Note:<br />
The more he ſpoke, the more ſhe ſtretch’d her Throat.<br />
In vain he proffer’d all his Goods, to fave<br />
His Body, deſtin’d to that living Grave.<br />
The liqu’riſh Hag rejects the Pelf with Scorm:<br />
And nothing but the Man would ſerve her Turn.<br />
‘Not all the Wealth of Eaſtern Kings, ſaid ſhe,<br />
‘Have Pow’r to part my plighted Love and me:<br />
‘And Old, and Ugly as I am, and Poor,<br />
‘Yet never will I break the Faith I ſwore!<br />
‘For mine thou art by Promiſe, during Life,<br />
‘And I thy loving and obedient Wife.’</p>
<p>‘My Love! Nay, rather my Damnation Thou,<br />
‘Said he; nor am I bound to keep my Vow:<br />
‘The Fiend, thy Sire, has ſent thee from below,<br />
‘Elſe how could’ſt thou my ſecret Sorrows know?<br />
‘Avant, old Witch; for I renounce thy Bed:<br />
‘The Queen may take the Forfeit of my Head,<br />
‘E’re any of my Race ſo foul a Crone ſhall wed.’</p>
<p>Both heard, the Judge pronounc’d againſt the Knight,<br />
So was he marry’d in his own deſpite:<br />
And all Day after hid him as an Owl,<br />
Not able to ſuſtain a Sight ſo foul.<br />
Perhaps the Reader thinks I do him Wrong, |<br />
To paſs the Marriage-Feaſt and Nuptial Song:<br />
Mirth there was none, the Man was <em>a-la-mort</em>,<br />
And little Courage had to make his Court.<br />
To Bed they went, the Bridegroom and the Bride:<br />
Was never ſuch an ill-pair’d Couple ty’d.<br />
Reſtleſs, he toſs’d and tumbled to and fro,<br />
And roll’d and wriggled further off for Woe.<br />
The good old Wife lay ſmiling by his Side,<br />
And caught him in her quiv’ring Arms, and cry’d,<br />
‘When you my raviſh’d Predeceſſor ſaw,<br />
‘You were not then become this Man of Straw;<br />
‘Had you been ſuch, you might have ‘ſcap’d the Law.<br />
‘Is this the Cuſtom of King Artbur’s Court?<br />
‘Are all Round-Table Knights of ſuch a Sort?<br />
‘Remember I am ſhe who ſav’d your Life,<br />
‘Your loving, lawful, and complying Wife:<br />
‘Not thus you ſwore in your unhappy Hour,<br />
‘Nor I for this Return employ’d my Pow’r.<br />
‘In time of Need I was your faithful Friend;<br />
‘Nor did I ſince, nor ever will offend.<br />
‘Believe me, my lov’d Lord, ‘tis much unkind;<br />
‘What Fury has poſſeſs’d your alter’d Mind?<br />
‘Thus on my Wedding-Night — without Pretence—<br />
‘Come, turn this Way, or tell me my Offence.<br />
‘If not your Wife, let Reaſon’s Rule perſuade;<br />
‘Name but my Fault, Amends ſhall ſoon be made.<br />
‘Amends! Nay, that’s impofſible, ſaid he;<br />
‘What Change of Age or Uglineſs can be?<br />
‘Or, could <em>Medea</em>’s Magick mend thy Face,<br />
‘Thou art deſcended from ſo mean a Race,<br />
‘That never Knight was match’d with ſuch Diſgrace.<br />
‘What Wonder, Madam, if I move my Side,<br />
‘When, if I turn, I turn to ſuch a Bride?’</p>
<p>‘And is this all that troubles you ſo ſore?<br />
‘And what the Devil could’ſt thou wiſh me more?<br />
‘Ah, <em>Benedicite</em>! reply’d the Crone:<br />
‘Then Cauſe of juſt Complaining you have none.<br />
‘The Remedy to this were ſoon apply’d,<br />
‘Wou’d you be like the Bridegroom to the Bride.<br />
‘But (for you ſay, a long-deſcended Race,<br />
‘And Wealth and Dignity, and Pow’r and Place,<br />
‘Make Gentlemen, and that your high Degree<br />
‘Is much diſparag’d to be match’d with me;)<br />
‘Know this, my Lord, Nobility of Blood<br />
‘Is but a glitt’ring and fallacious Good:<br />
‘The Nobleman is he, whoſe noble Mind<br />
‘Is fill’d with inborn Worth, unborrow’d from his Kind,<br />
‘The King of Heav’n was in a Manger laid,<br />
‘And took his Earth but from an humble Maid;<br />
‘Then what can Birth, or mortal Men beſtow?<br />
‘Since Floods no higher than their Fountains flow.<br />
‘We, who for Name and empty Honour ſtrive,<br />
‘Our true Nobility from him derive.<br />
‘Your Anceſtors, who puff your Mind with Pride,<br />
‘And vaſt Eſtates to mighty Titles ty’d,<br />
‘Did not your Honour, but their own advance:<br />
‘For Virtue comes not by Inheritance.<br />
‘If you tralineate from your Father’s Mind,<br />
‘What are you elſe but of a Baſtard-kind?<br />
‘Do as your great Progenitors have done,<br />
‘And by your Virtues prove yourſelf their Son.<br />
‘No Father can infuſe, or Wit or Grace;<br />
‘A Mother comes acroſs, and marrs the Race.<br />
‘A Grandſire or a Grandame taints the Blood;<br />
‘And ſeldom three Deſcents continue Good.<br />
‘Were Virtue by Deſcent, a noble Name<br />
‘Could never villanize his Father’s Fame;<br />
‘But as the firſt, the laſt of all the Line<br />
‘Would, like the Sun, ev’n in Deſcending ſhine.<br />
‘Take Fire, and bear it to the darkeſt Houſe<br />
‘Betwixt King <em>Arthur</em>’s Court and <em>Caucaſus</em>,<br />
‘If you depart, the Flame ſhall ſtill remain,<br />
‘And the bright Blaze enlighten all the Plain:<br />
‘Nor, till the Fuel periſh, can decay,<br />
‘By Nature form’d on Things combuſtible to Prey.<br />
‘Such is not Man, who mixing better Seed<br />
‘With worſe, begets a baſe degen’rate Breed:<br />
‘The Bad corrupts the Good, and leaves behind<br />
‘No Trace of all the great Begetter’s Mind.<br />
‘The Father ſinks within his Son, we ſee,<br />
‘And often riſes in the third Degree:<br />
‘If better Luck a better Mother give;<br />
‘Chance gave us Being, and by Chance we live.<br />
‘Such as our Atoms were, ev’n ſuch are we,<br />
‘Or call it Chance, or ſtrong Neceſſity,<br />
‘Thus, loaded with dead Weight, the Will is free.<br />
‘And thus it needs muſt be: For Seed conjoin’d<br />
‘Lets into Nature’s Work the imperfect Kind:<br />
‘But Fire, th’ Enliv’ner of the gen’ral Frame,<br />
‘Is One, its Operations ſtill the ſame.<br />
‘Its Principle is in itſelf: While ours<br />
‘Works, as Confed’rates war, wich mingled Pow’rs:<br />
‘Or Man, or Woman, whichſoever fails:<br />
‘And, oft, the Vigour of the worſe prevails.<br />
‘<em>Aether</em> with <em>Sulphur</em> blended alters Hue,<br />
‘And caſts a duſky Gleam of <em>Sodom</em> blue.<br />
‘Thus in a Brute, their ancient Honour ends,<br />
‘And the fair Mermaid in a Fiſh deſcends:<br />
‘The Line is gone; no longer Duke or Earl;<br />
‘But, by himſelf degraded, turns a Churl.<br />
‘Nobility of Blood is but Renown<br />
‘Of thy great Fathers, by their Virtue known,<br />
‘And a long Trail of Light to thee deſcending down,<br />
‘If in thy Smoke it ends, their Glories ſhine;<br />
‘But Infamy and Villanage are thine.<br />
‘Then what I ſaid before is plainly ſhow’d,<br />
‘The true Nobility proceeds from God:<br />
‘Not left us by Inheritance, but giv’n<br />
‘By Bounty of our Stars, and Grace of Heav’n,<br />
‘Thus from a Captive <em>Servius Tullus</em> roſe,<br />
‘Whom for his Virtues the firſt Romans choſe;<br />
‘<em>Fabritius</em> from their Walls repell’d the Foe,<br />
‘Whoſe noble Hands had exercis’d the Plough.<br />
‘From hence, my Lord and Love, I thus conclude,<br />
‘That tho’ my homely Anceſtors were rude,<br />
‘Mean as I am, yet I may have the Grace.<br />
‘To make you Father of a gen’rous Race:<br />
‘And Noble then am I, when I begin,<br />
‘In Virtue cloth’d, to caſt the Rags of Sin:<br />
‘If Poverty be my upbraided Crime,<br />
‘And you believe in Heav’n, there was a Time<br />
‘When He, the great Controller of our Fate,<br />
‘Deign’d to be Man, and liv’d in low Eſtate:<br />
‘Which he, who had the World at his Diſpoſe,<br />
‘If Poverty were Vice, would never chooſe.<br />
‘Philoſophers have ſaid, and Poets ſing,<br />
‘<em>That a glad Poverty’s an honeſt Thing.</em><br />
‘Content is Wealth, the Riches of the Mind;<br />
‘And happy He who can that Treaſure find.<br />
‘But the baſe Miſer ſtarves amidſt his Store,<br />
‘Broods on his Gold, and griping ſtill at more,<br />
‘Sits ſadly pining, and believes he’s poor.<br />
The ragged Beggar, tho’ he wants Relief,<br />
‘Has not to loſe, and <em>ſings before the Thief</em>.<br />
‘Want is a bitter and a hateful Good,<br />
‘Becauſe its Virtues are not underſtood:<br />
‘Yet many Things, impoſſible to Thought,<br />
‘Have been by Need to full Perfection brought:<br />
‘The Daring of the Soul proceeds from thence,<br />
‘Sharpneſs of Wit, and active Diligence:<br />
‘Prudence at once, and Fortitude it gives,<br />
‘And, if in Patience ta’en, it mends our Lives:<br />
‘For ev’n that Indigence that brings me low,<br />
‘Makes me Myſelf, and Him above to know.<br />
‘A Good which none wound challenge, few would chooſe;<br />
‘A fair Poſſeſſion, which Mankind refuſe.<br />
‘If we from Wealth to Poverty deſcend,<br />
‘Want gives to know the Flatt’rer from the Friend.<br />
‘If I am Old and Ugly, well for you;<br />
‘No lewd Adult’rer will my Love purſue.<br />
‘Nor Jealouſy, the Bane of Marry’d Life,<br />
‘Shall haunt you, for a wither’d homely Wiſe:<br />
‘For Age and Uglineſs, as all agree,<br />
‘Are the beſt Guards of Female Chaſtity.</p>
<p>‘Yet, fince I ſee your Mind is worldly bent,<br />
‘I’ll do my beſt to further your Content.<br />
‘And therefore, of two Gifts in my Diſpoſe,<br />
‘Think e’re you ſpeak, I grant you Leave to chooſe:<br />
‘Would you I ſhould be ſtill Deform’d and Old,<br />
‘Nauſeous to touch, and loathſom to Behold;<br />
‘On this Condition, to remain for Life<br />
‘A careful, tender, and obedient Wife,<br />
‘In all I can contribute to your Eaſe,<br />
‘And not in Deed; or Word, or Thought diſpleaſe?<br />
‘Or, would you rather have me Young and Fair,<br />
‘And take the Chance that happens to your Share?<br />
‘Temptations are in Beauty, and in Youth;<br />
‘And how can you depend upon my Truth?<br />
‘Now weigh the Danger with the doubtful Bliſs,<br />
‘And thank yourſelf, if aught ſhould fall amiſ.’</p>
<p>Sore ſigh’d the Knight, who this long Sermon heard;<br />
At length, conſid’ring all, his Heart he chear’d;<br />
And thus reply’d: ‘My Lady, and my Wife,<br />
‘To your wiſe Conduct I reſign my Life:<br />
‘Chooſe you for me; for well you underſtand<br />

‘Yours be the Care to profit, and to pleaſe;<br />

<p>‘Then thus in Peace, quoth ſhe, concludes the Strife,<br />
‘Since I am turn’d the Huſband, you the Wife:<br />

<p>Here beginneth the Tale of the Wife of Bath.</p>
<p>In the old days of King Arthur, of whom Britons speak great glory, this land was all filled with fairy power. The elf-queen danced full oft, with her merry company, in many a green mead; this was the belief of old, as I find in books. I speak of many hundred years ago; but in our times no man can see elves any more. For now the great charity and the prayers of limiters and of other holy friars, who reach every land and every brook, as thick as motes in a sunbeam, blessing halls, towers, chambers, kitchens, cities, burgs, castles, thorps, dairies, barns, stables, bowers, — this brings it to pass that there be no elves. For where a fairy was wont to walk, there walks the limiter himself now, of mornings or of afternoons, and says his matins and his holy things as he goes in his mendicancy. Women may go up and down in safety ; in every bush, under every tree, save him, there is none incubus, — and he will do them nought but dishonor.</p>
<p>And so befell that this King Arthur had a lusty young knight in his court, who on a day came riding from the river; and it happed that he saw a maid walking ahead alone as she was born, and her he ravished. For this violation there was such clamor and such appeal unto King Arthur, that the knight was condemned by course of law to die; and peradventure, such was the statute then, he would have lost his head, but that the queen and other ladies so long prayed the king for grace, till he granted him his life thereupon, and gave him over to the queen’s will, to choose whether she would save him or let him die.</p>
<p>The queen thanked the king right heartily; and after this, upon a day when she saw her time, she spake thus to the knight: ‘You stand yet,’ quoth she, ‘in such case that you have even now no assurance of your life. I grant you life, if you can tell me what thing it is that women desire most. Beware, and guard your neckbone from iron! And if you cannot tell it forthwith, I will give you yet leave to go for a twelvemonth and a day, to search out and learn an answer sufficient for this point. And ere you depart, I will have security that you will yield up your body in this place.’</p>
<p>Woe was this knight, and he sighed sorrowfully. But what! He might not do even as he list. And at last he chose to go and come again even at the year’s end, with such reply as God should purvey him; and he took his leave and went his way forth.</p>
<p>He sought every house and place where he hoped to find such luck as to learn what women chiefly love. But he could arrive at no coast where he could find two creatures agreeing together on this thing. Some said that women best love riches; some said honor; some said mirth; some, rich array; some, lusty husbands, and to be widowed and wedded often. Some said that our hearts are most eased when we be flattered and gratified. They came full nigh the truth; a man shall best win us by flattery, I will not deny it, and by attentiveness and diligence we are caught, both great and small. And some said how we love best to be free and to do even as we will, and that no man reprove us for our faults, but say that we be wise and never foolish at all. For in sooth there is none amongst us, if any wight claw us on a sore place, that will not kick, because he tells us the truth. Try, and he shall find it out who does so. For be we never so sinful within, we would be held for wise, and clean of evil-doing.</p>
<p>And some said that we have great delight to be accounted stable and eke trustworthy and steadfast in one purpose, and never bewraying what men tell us. But that tale is not worth a rake-handle, perdy! We women can conceal nothing, as witness Midas; will ye hear the tale?</p>
<p>Ovid, amongst other small stories, says that Midas had two ass’s ears growmg upon his head under his lone hair, which blemish he hid full cunningly from every man’s sight, as best he could, so that none wist of it save his wife. He loved her most and trusted her; and he prayed her to tell of his disfigurement to no creature. She swore to him, ‘Nay, not to gain all the world she would not do that villainy and sin, to bring her husband so foul a name; for her own honor she would not do it.’ But nevertheless she felt she should die, to hide a secret so long; it swelled so sore about her heart, it seemed to her, that some word must needs burst from her. And since she durst tell it to no human creature, she ran down to a marsh hard by; her heart was ablaze till she came there. And ever as a bittern bumbles in the mire, she laid her mouth down unto the water: Thou water, bewray me not with thy sound,’ quoth she ; ‘I tell it to thee, and to none else. Mine husband hath two lone ass’s ears. Now my heart is whole and well again; now it is out. In very truth I could keep it in no longer.’ By this you may see that though we bide a time, we can conceal no secret forever; it must out. If you will hear the remnant of the tale, read Ovid; there you may learn it.</p>
<p>This knight, of whom is my tale chiefly, when he saw he could not come by it — that is to say, what women most love — full sorrowful was the spirit withm his breast. But home he went, he might not tarry; the day was come when he must turn homeward. And as he went, deep in care, it befell that he , rode under a forest-side, where he saw four-and-twenty ladies and yet more go on a dance. Full eagerly he drew toward this dance, in hope of learning some piece of wisdom. But in truth, ere he fully came there, the dance was vanished — where, he wist not; and he discerned no living creature, save that he saw sitting on the green an old wife, a fouler wight none could imagine. At the approach of the knight this old wife arose and said, ‘Sir knight, by this way lies no path. Tell me, by your faith, what seek you? Peradventure it may be the better for you; these old folk know many a thing.’</p>
<p>‘My dear mother,’ quoth this knight, ‘in truth I am but a dead man, unless I can say what thing it is that women desire most. Could you instruct me, I would well pay you your reward.’</p>
<p>‘Plight me your troth,’ quoth she, ‘on my hand here, that you will do the first thing that I require of you, if it lie in your power; and ere it be night I will tell it you.’</p>
<p>‘Take my pledge here,’ said the knight, ‘I agree.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ quoth she, ‘I dare be bound your life is safe; for upon my soul I will stand to it that the queen will say as I do. Let see the proudest kerchief or caul of the whole court, who dares say nay to what I shall teach you. Let us go on, without further words.’</p>
<p>Then she whispered a word in his ear, and bade him be glad and have no dread.</p>
<p>When they were come to the court, this knight said ‘he had kept his day, as he had promised, and ready was his answer.’ Then were assembled to hear his answer full many a noble wife, and many a maiden, and many a widow, — because they be wise; and the queen herself sat as justicer. And then this knight was summoned. Silence was commanded to every wight, and the knight was bidden tell in full audience what thing mortal women most love. This knight stood not like a dumb beast, but anon answered the question with manly voice, that all the court heard it. ‘My liege lady,’ quoth he, ‘over all this world women wish to have sovereignty over their husbands as well as over their lovers, and to be in mastership above them. This is your chiefest desire, though you slay me for the word; do as you list, I am here at your will.’</p>
<p>In all the court there was neither wife nor maid nor widow to gainsay what he replied, but all declared he was worthy to have his freedom. And at that word, the old woman started up whom the knight had seen sitting on the green.</p>
<p>‘Your favor, my sovereign lady!’ quoth she. ‘Do me justice, ere your court break up. I taught the knight this answer, for which he plighted me his faith that he would do the first thing I should require of him, if it lay in his power. Before the court, then, I pray you, sir knight,’ quoth she, ‘that you take me to wife, for you well know that I have saved your neck. If I speak falsely, say me nay, upon your faith!’</p>
<p>This knight answered, ‘I wot full well that such was my promise, alas and alack! But for the love of God, pray choose another request! Take all my goods; let my body go.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then,’ answered she, ‘I beshrew us both. For though I be foul, poor, and old, I would none of all the metal or ore that is buried under the earth or lies upon it, but I were thy wife, and thy love eke.’</p>
<p>‘My love!’ quoth he, ‘nay, my damnation! Alas that any of my kindred should be so foully mismated!’</p>
<p>But all this was for nought. This is the conclusion, that he was constrained, and needs must wed her. And he took his old wife and went to his chamber.</p>
<p>Now peradventure some men would say that of my negligence I take no care to tell you all the rejoicing and pomp which was at the celebration that day. To which thing I shall briefly answer, and say there was no joy nor celebration at all; but only heaviness and much sorrow. For he wedded her privily on a morn; and such was his woe, hid him all day after like an owl, his wife looked so ugly.</p>
<p>Great was his misery when he was alone with his wife; he tossed about and turned to and fro. His old wife lay evermore smiling, and said, ‘Ah, <em>benedicite</em>, dear husband! fares every knight thus with his wife as you do? Is this the way of King Arthur’s household? Is every knight of his so distant? I am your own love and your wife eke, and I have saved your neck, and certes, I have never yet done you a wrong. Why do you so this first night? You fare as a man who has lost his wit. What is my guilt? Tell it me, for the love of God, and if I have the power, it shall be amended.’</p>
<p>‘Amended!’ quoth this knight. ‘Alas, nay, nay; it cannot be amended forevermore! You are so loathly and so old, and eke come of so low a lineage, that it is small wonder though I toss and turn. Would God my heart would burst!’</p>
<p>‘Is this the cause of your unquiet?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, certainly, and no wonder,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘Now, sir,’ she replied, ‘I could amend all this ere three days were gone, if I list, so you bear yourself toward me well.</p>
<p>‘But when you speak of such gentility as is descended from ancient wealth, so that therefor you knights are men of breeding, — such arrogance is not worth a hen. Look who is ever most virtuous, openly and privily, and ever most inclines to do what gentle deeds he may; take him for the gentlest man. Christ wills that we claim our gentility from him, not from our ancestors’ ancient wealth. For though all their heritage, by reason whereof we claim high station, descend to us, yet they cannot at all bequeath to any of us their virtuous living, which made them to be called gentle men and to bid us follow them and do in like manner. The wise poet of Florence, who is named Dante, has a noble saying on this matter; lo, in such rhyme is Dante’s saying:—</p>
<p>“Seldom into the brtnches of the tree<br />
Mounts worth of man, for He that gives it to us<br />
Wills that of Him we claim nobility.”</p>
<p>For we may claim naught as from our ancestors save temporal things which men may injure and impair. Every wight eke knows this as well as I, that if nobility were planted by nature in a certain family all down the line, then would they never cease to do the fair offices of nobility, both privately and before the world; they could never do villainy or sin. Take fire and bear it into the darkest house betwixt here and the mount of Caucasus, and let men shut the doors and go thence, nevertheless the fire will burn and blaze as fairly as though twenty thousand men beheld it ; on peril of my life, it will hold to its natural office till it die! Here you may well see how nobility hangs not from ancient possessions, since folk perform not alway its works, as does the fire, lo! according to its nature. For, God wot, men may full often see a lord’s son do shame and baseness; and he that will have esteem for gentility because he was born of a noble house and had virtuous and noble ancestors, and yet himself will not perform the deeds of gentility nor follow after his gentle ancestor who is dead, he is not noble, be he duke or baron; for base sinful deeds make a churl. For gentility then were but renown of your ancestors for their high worthiness, which is full extraneous to your person. Your gentility comes only from God. Then comes our true gentility of divine grace, and was in no wise bequeathed to us with our earthly station.</p>
<p>‘Think how noble was that Tullius Hostilius, as Valerius tells, who rose out of poverty to high nobility. Read Seneca, and Boethius eke; there you shall see expressly that he who does noble deeds is noble. And therefore, dear husband, I conclude thus: albeit mine ancestors were untutored, yet may the high God — and so I hope — grant me grace to live virtuously. Then I am noble, when I begin to live virtuously and to abandon evil.</p>
<p>‘And you reproach me for poverty; but the high God on whom we believe chose freely to live in poverty. And certes every man, maid or wife, may well know that Jesus, King of Heaven, would not choose an ill manner of living. Verily, cheerful poverty is an honorable thing, so will Seneca say and other clerks. Whoso holds him content with his poverty, I count him rich, though he have not a shirt! He who covets is a poor wight, for he would have that which is not within his power. But he that has naught, nor covets to have, is rich, albeit you count him but a serving-lad. True poverty, it sings by nature. Juvenal says merrily, concerning poverty:—</p>
<p>“The poor man as he strides along<br />
Before the thieves may sing a song.”</p>
<p>Poverty is a hateful good, and a full great ridder from cares, I trow, and eke a great teacher of wisdom to him that takes it in patience. All this is poverty, though it seem wretched; and a possession which no wight will challenge. When a man is humbled, full often poverty makes him to know his God and himself eke. Poverty methinks is a perspective glass through which he may see who are his true friends. And therefore, sir, I pray, so I grieve you not, upbraid me no more for my poverty.</p>
<p>‘Now, sir, you reproach me for mine old age. And certes, sir, though there were no authority in any book to tell you so, yet you honorable gentlefolk say that men should do courtesy to an old wight, and for your gentle manners call him Father. And I could find authorities for this, I trow. Now you say I am old and foul — then dread you not to be a cuckold. For ugliness and age, on my life, are great wardens over chastity. But nevertheless, since I know what it is you would have, I shall fulfil your worldly will.</p>
<p>‘Choose,’ quoth she, ‘one of these two things, to have me foul and old till I die, and to you a true, humble wife, never in all my days displeasing you ; or else to have me young and fair, and take your adventure of the resorting to your house — or mayhap to some other place — which there will be for my sake. Now choose yourself which you will have.’</p>
<p>This knight took counsel with himself and sighed sore; but at last he spake after this manner: ‘My lady and love, and my dear wife, I put me in your wise governance. Do you choose which may be greatest pleasure and greatest honor to you and me also; I care not which of the two, for it suffices me as it pleases you.’</p>
<p>‘Then have I got the mastery over you,* quoth she, ‘since I may make choice, and control as I list?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, certes, wife,’ quoth he; ‘I hold that for the best.’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘Kiss me, we be angered no longer. For by my faith I will be both unto you — that is to say, both fair, yea, and good. I pray to God that I may die mad, but I be as good and faithful as ever wife was since the world was new. And except I be in the morn as fair to see as any lady, queen or empress, betwixt the east and the west, do with my life and death as you will. Cast up the curtain, look how it is.’</p>
<p>And when the knight saw verily that she was so fair and likewise so young, he clasped her in his two arms for joy, his heart bathed in a bath of bliss. A thousand times together he kissed her.</p>
<p>And she obeyed him in all which might cause him delight or pleasure. And thus they lived in perfect joy to the end of their lives. And may Jesu Christ send us husbands meek, young, and lusty, and grace to overlive them that we wed. And eke I pray Jesu to shorten their days that will not be ruled by their wives. And old, angry niggards of money, God send them betimes a very pestilence!</p>
<p>Here endeth the Wife of Bath’s Tale.</p>

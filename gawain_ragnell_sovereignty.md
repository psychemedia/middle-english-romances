# Sir Gawain and His Marriage to Lady Ragnell

This is one of the tales I remember hearing most frequently when we first started listening to storytellers, and it is one that I have a soft spot for.

The core of the tale is follows:

> King Arthur is out hunting and gets separated from his party;  he meets a knight who would challenge him, say Gawain has taken his lands from him. Arthur must give way, promising to return by the next New Year's Day with the answer to the question "What is it that a woman desire's the most?" else he will cut off his head. Arthur returns to court unhappily, sets out with Gawain for anwsers, but none of them seem satisfactory. On the way to meet the Lord, Arthur meets a hideous hag. She says she has the answer, but the price is that she weds Gawain. Arthur checks with Gawain, ho says he will do what he must for his King. She gives the answer to Arthur and he gives it to the Lord; and the Lord is angry - his sister must have told Arthur.
>
> Back at court, the hag arrives, eats noisily, and goes off with Gawain. He is astonished to see she is beautiful; she says she is under an enchantment, and will he have her foul by day and fair by night, or v.v. He flounders, says it is her choice. She is released from the curse and the next morning the court is surprised to see Gawain with the fair maiden.

Structurally, the tale includes two dilemmas (Sir Gromersomer Joure's challenge to Arthur, Dame Ragnell's to Gawain), with the answer to the first needing to be realised to settle the second.

A version of the original romance is given by Madden:

The Weddynge of S. Gawene and Dame Ragnelle. fol. 128°.

Printed in the present volume, Appendix, No. VIII. This is the identical poem referred to erroneously by Warton as existing in one of the Tanner MSS. (See Notes; p. 358.) For its discovery, (after the greater part of the sheets of this work was printed off,) I am indebted to the Rev. Henry O. Coxe, Assistant Librarian of the Bodleian Library, who most kindly and promptly undertook a transcript, which was subsequently compared by myself with the Manuscript. It is, unquestionably, the original of the mutilated poem in the Percy folio, and is sufficiently curious to render its insertion in the Appendix an object of interest, although, had I been earlier aware of its existence, some change would probably have been made in the arrangement. The title in the MS. is added by a later hand, and the poem itself is very carelessly written, so that several lines appear occasionally omitted. An entire page, containing ??? lines, is, unfortunately, wanting.

No. VIII.

The weddynge of S Gawen & Dame Ragnell.

[MS. Rawlinson, C.86, fol. 128. b ]

Lyhte! `[Klythe, MS.]` and liftenyth the lif' of a lord' riche,  
The while that he lyvid' was none hym liche,  
Nether in bowre ne in halle;—  
In the tyme of Arthour thys adventure betyd,'—  
And' of the greatt adventure that he hym felf dyd',  
That kyng curteys & royall.  
Of alle kynge Arture beryth the flowyr,  
And' of alle knyghtod' he bare away the hono',  
Where foeu he wentt;  
In hys contrey was no thyng butt chyvalry,  
And' knygtite were belovid' [by] that doughty,  
For cowarde were elmore fhent.  
Nowe wyll ye lyft a whyle to my talkyng,  
I fhall you tell of Arthowre the kyng,  
Howe ones hym befett;  
On huntyng he was in Inglefwod',  
With alle his bold' knyghte good',—  
Nowe herkef to my fpell.  
The kyng was fett att his treftyll-tree,  
With his bowe to fle the wylde ven'e,  
And' hys lorde were fett hym befyde;  
As the kyng ftode, then was he ware,  
Where a greatt hartt was and' a fayre,  
And' forth faft dyd' he glyde,  
The hartt was in a braken ferne,  
And' hard' the houndé, and' ftode full derne,  
Alle that fawe the kyng;—  
"Hold' you ftyll, euy mah,  
And' I woll goo my felf, yf I can,  
With craft of ftalkyng."  
The kyng in hys hand' toke a bowe,  
And' wodmanly he ftowpyd' lowe,  
To ftalk' vnto that dere;  
When that he cam the dere full nere,  
The dere lept forth into a brere,  
And eu the kyng went nere & nere.  
So kyng Arthure went a whyle,  
After the dere, I trowe, half a myle,  
And' no man with hym went;  
And' att the laft to the dere he lett flye,  
And' fmote hym fore and' fewerly,  
Suche grace God' hym fent.  
Doun the dere tumblyd' fo deron,  
And' fell into a greatt brake of feron,  
The kyng folowyd' full faft;  
Anon the kyng both ferce & fell  
Was with the dere, and' dyd' hym fvell `[ferve well?]`,  
And' after the graffe he tafte.  
As the kyng was with the dere alone,  
Streyght ther ca to hym a quaynt grome,  
Armyd' well and' fure;  
A knyght full ftrong, and' of greatt myght,  
And' grymly worde to the kyng he fayd',—  
"Well i-mett, kyng Arthor!  
Thou haft me done wrong many a yere,  
And' wofully I fhatt quytte the here,  
I hold thy lyfe-days nygh done;  
Thou haft gevyn my lande, in certayn,  
With greatt wrong vnto S. Gawen,  
Whate fayest thou, kyng alone ?"  
"Syr knyght, whate is thy name, with honor?"  
"Syr kyng," he fayd', "Grom'fom Jour',  
I tell the nowe with ryght."—  
"A, S. Grom'fom', bethynk' the well,  
To fle me here honor getyft thou no det,  
Be-thynk' the thou artt a knyght.  
Yf thou fle me nowe in thys cafe,  
Alle knyghte woll refufe the in euy place,  
That fhame fhall new the froo;  
Lett be thy wyll, and folowe wytt,  
And' that is amys I fhall amend?' itt,  
And' thou wolt, or that I goo."  
"Nay," fayd' S. Grom'fom", "by heuyn kyng!  
So fhalt thou nott fkape, withoute lefyng,  
I haue the nowe att avayll;  
Yf I fhold' lett the thus goo with mokery,  
Anoder tyme thou wolt me defye,  
Of that I fhatt nott fayll."  
Now fayd' the kyng, "fo God' me faue,  
Save my lyfe, and' whate thou wolt crave  
I fhall now graunt itt the;  
Shame thou fhalt haue to fle me in ven'e,  
Thou armyd', and I clothyd' butt in grene, pde."  
"Alle thys fhatt nott help the, fekyrly,  
For I woll nother lond' ne gold' truly,  
Butt yf thou graunt me att a certayn day,  
Suche as I fhatt fett, and' in thys fame araye."  
"Yes," fayd' the kyng, "lo! here my hand'."  
"Ye, butt a-byde, kyng, and' here me a ftound'.  
Fyrft thow fhalt fwere, vpoh my fword' broun,  
To fhewe me att thy comyng whate wemefi love beft' in feld' and'  town;
And' thou fhalt mete me here, with outen fend',  
Evyn att this day xij. monethes end';  
And' thou fhalt fwere vpoh my fwerd' good',  
That of thy knyghte fhall none com w' the, by the rood',  
Nowther frende `[fremde?]` ne freynd'.  
And' yf thou bryng nott anfwere, with oute fayll,  
Thyne hed' thou fhalt lofe for thy travayll,—  
Thys fhall nowe be thyne oth.  
Whate fayft thou, kyng, lett fe, haue done.""—  
"Syr, I graunt to thys, now lett me gone,  
Though itt be to me full loth.  
I enfure the, as I am true kyng,  
To com agayn att thys xij. monethes end',  
And' bryng the thyne anfwere."—  
"Now go thy way, kyng Arthure,  
Thy lyfe is in my hand' I am full fure,  
Of thy forowe thow artt nott ware.  
Abyde, kyng Arthure, a lytell whyle,  
Loke nott to day thou me begyle,  
And' kepe alle thyng in clofe;  
For and' I wyft, by Mary mylde,  
Thou woldyft betray me in the feld',  
Thy lyf? fyrft fholdyft thou lofe."  
"Nay," fayd' kyng Arthure, "that may nott be,  
Vutrewe knyght fhalt thou new fynde me,  
To dye yett were me lever;  
Farwett, S. knyght, and' evyll mett,  
I woll com, and' I be of lyve, att the day fett,  
Though I fhold' fcape neu."  
The kyng his bugle gan blowe,  
That hard' euy knygtit, and' itt gan knowe,  
Vnto hym can they rake;  
Ther they fond' the kyng and' the dere,  
With fembland' fad' and' hevy chere,  
That had' no luft to layk'.  
"Go we home nowe to Carlyll,  
Thys huntyng lykys me nott well.'"—  
So fayd' kyng Arthure;  
Alle the lord¢ knewe by his counten"nce,  
That the kyng had' mett with fume dyfturbaunce.  
Vnto Carlyll then the kyng cam,  
Butt of his hevyneffe knewe no man,  
His hartt was wonder hevy;  
In this hevyneffe he dyd' a-byde,  
That many of his knyghte m'velyd' that tyde.  
Tyll att the laft S. Gawen  
To the kyng he fayd' than,  
"Syr, me marvaylyth ryght fore,  
Whate thyng that thou forowyft fore."  
Then anfweryd' the kyng as tyght,  
"I fhall the tell, gentyll Gawen knyght.  
In the foreft as I was this daye,  
Ther I mett with a knygiit in his araye,  
And' fteyn worde to me he gan fayn,  
And' chargyd' me I fhold' hym nott bewrayne;  
His councell muft I kepe therfore,  
Or els I am forfwore."  
"Nay, drede you nott, lord', by Mary flower',  
I am nott that man that wold' you difhonor,  
Nother by euyn ne by moron."—  
"Forsoth I was of huntyng in Inglefwod'
Thowe knoweft well I flewe an hartt, by the rode,  
Alle my fylf alon;  
Ther mett I with a knyght armyd' fure,  
His name he told' me was S. Grom' fom' Joure,  
Therfor I make my mone.  
Ther that knyght faft dyd' me threte,  
And' wold' haue flay me with greatt heatt,  
But I fpak' fayre agayn;  
Wepyns with me ther had' I none,  
Alas! my worfhypp' therfor is nowe gone." —  
"What therof?" fayd' Gawen.  
"What nedys more, I fhall nott lye,  
He wold' haue flayn me ther with oute m'cy,  
And' that me was full loth;  
He made me to fwere that att the xij. monethes end',  
That I fhold' mete hym ther in the fame kynde,  
To that I plyght my trowith.  
And' alfo I fhold' tell hym att the fame day,  
Whate wemen defyren mofte, in good faye,  
My lyf' els fhold' I lefe `[leve, MS.]`;  
This oth I made vnto that knygitt,  
And' that I fhold' neu tell itt to no wight,  
Of thys I myght nott chefe.  
And' alfo I fhold' com in none oder araye,  
But euyn as I was the fame daye;  
And' yf I faylyd' of myne anfwere,  
I wott I fhal be flay rygtt there.  
Blame me nott though I be a wofutt man,  
Alle thys is my drede and' fere."  
"Ye, S,, make good' chere,—  
Lett make yor hors redy,  
To ryde into ftraunge contrey;  
And eu wher as ye mete owther man or woman, in faye,  
Ask' of theym whate thay therto faye.  
And' I fhall alfo ryde a noder waye,  
And' enquere of euy man and' woman, and' gett whatt I may,  
Of euy mah and' womans anfwere,  
And in a boke I fhall theym wryte."  
"I graunt," fayd' the kyng, as tyte,  
"Ytt is well advyfed, Gawen the good',  
Evyn by the holy rood' !"—  
Sone were they `[the, MS.]` both redy,  
Gawen and' the kyng, wytterly.  
The kyng rode on way, and' Gawen anoder,  
And eu enquyred' of man, woman, and' other,  
Whate wemen defyred' mofte dere.  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' to be well arayd',  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' to be fayre prayed';  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' a lufty mah,  
That in theyr armys can clypp' them and' kyffe them than;  
Somme fayd' one, fomme fayd' other,  
And' fo had' Gawen getyn many an anfwer'.  
By that Gawen had' geten whate he maye,  
And come agayn by a certeyn daye;  
Syr Gawen had' goten anfwerys fo many,  
That had' made a boke greatt, wytterly,  
To the courte he cam agayn;  
By that was the kyng comyn with hys boke,  
And' eyther on others pamplett dyd' loke,—  
"Thys may nott fayd' `[faylle?]`," fayd' Gawen.  
"By God'," fayd' the kyng, "I drede me fore,  
I caft me to feke a lytell more,  
In Ynglefwod' Foreft;  
I haue butt a moneth to my day fett,  
I may hapeh oh fomme good' tydynge to hytt,  
Thys thynkyth me nowe beft."  
"Do as ye lyft," then Gawen fayd',  
"What fo eu ye do I hold' me payd',  
Hytt is good' to be fpyrryng;  
Doute you nott, lord', ye fhait well fpede,  
Sume of yor fawes fhall help att nede,  
Els itt were yll lykyng."  
Kyng Arthoure rode forth on the other day,  
In to Ynglefwod' as hys gate laye,  
And' ther he mett with a lady;  
She was as vngoodly a creature,  
As eu man fawe, withoute mefure,  
Kyng Arthure m'vaylyd' fecurly.  
Her face was red', her nofe fnotyd' withall,  
Her mowith wyde, her teth yalowe ou all,  
With bleryd' eyen gretter then a ball,  
Her mowith was nott to lak';  
Her teth hyng out her `[he, MS.]` lyppe,  
Her chekys fyde as wemens hyppe,  
A lute fhe bare vpon her bak'.  
Her nek' long and' therto greatt,  
Her here cloteryd of af hepe,  
In the fholders fhe was a yard' brode,  
Hangyng pappys to be an hors-lode,  
And' lyke a barell fhe was made;  
And' to reherfe the fowlneffe of that lady,  
Ther is no tung may tell, fecurly,  
Of lothlyneffe inowgt fhe had'.  
She fatt on a palfray was gay begon,  
With gold befett, and many a precious ftone,  
Ther was an vnfemely fyght;  
So fowll a creature, with oute mefure,  
To ryde fo gayly, I you enfure,  
Ytt was no reafoh ne ryght.  
She rode to Arthoure, and thus fhe fayd',  
"God' fpede, kyng, I am well payd',  
That I haue with the mett;  
Speke with me, I rede, or thou goo,  
For thy lyfe is in my hand', I warn the foo,  
That fhalt thou fynde, and' I itt nott lett."  
"Why, what wold' ye, lady, nowe with me?"  
"Syr, I wold' fayn nowe fpeke with the,  
And tell the tydynge good';  
For alle the anfwerys that thou canft yelpe,  
None of theym alle fhall the helpe,  
That fhalt thou knowe, by the rood'! 
Thou wenyft I knowe nott thy councell,  
But I warn the I knowe itt euy deall,  
Yf `[In the MS. part of the previous line is carelessly repeated.]` I help the nott thou art butt dead?;  
Graunt me, S. kyng, butt one thyng,  
And' for thy lyfe I make warrauntyng,  
Or elle thou fhalt lofe thy hed'."  
"Whate mean you, lady, tell me tygtit,  
For of thy worde I haue great difpyte,  
To you I haue no nede.  
Whate is yor defyre, fayre lady,  
Lett me wete fhortly,  
Whate is yor meanyng;  
And' why my lyfe is in yor hand',  
Tell me, and' I fhall you warraunt,  
Alle yor oun afkyng ?"  
"For foth," fayd' the lady, "I am no qued',  
Thou muft graunt me a knyght to wed',  
His name is S. Gawen;  
And' fuche couen‘nt I woll make the,  
Butt thorowe myne anfwere thy lyf' fauyd' be,  
Elle lett my defyre be in vayne.  
And' yf myne anfwere faue thy lyf',  
Graunt me to be Gawens wyf',  
Advyfe the nowe, S. kyng;  
For itt muft be fo, or thou artt butt dead',  
Chofe nowe, for thou mayfte fone lofe thyne hed'.  
Tell me nowe in hying."  
"Mary," fayd' the kyng, "I maye nott graunt the,  
To make warrant S. Gawen to wed' the,  
Alle lyeth in hym alon;  
Butt and' itt be fo, I woll do my labor,  
In favyng of my lyfe to make itt secor,  
To Gawen woll I make my mone."  
"Well," fayd' fhe, "nowe go home agayn,  
And' fayre worde fpeke to S. Gawen,  
For thy lyf? I may faue;  
Though I be foull, yett am I gaye,  
Thourgh me thy lyfe faue he maye,  
Or fewer thy deth to haue."  
"Alas !"? he fayd', "now woo is me,  
That I fhold' caufe Gawen to wed' the,  
For he wol be loth to faye naye;  
So foull a lady as ye ar nowe one  
Sawe I neu in my lyfe on ground' gone,  
I nott whate I do may."  
"No force, S. kyng, thougt I be foull,  
Choyfe for a make hatti an owll,  
Thou geteft of me no more;  
When thou comyft agayn to thyne anfwer',  
Ryght in this place I shatt mete the here,  
Or elle I wott thou artt lore `[lore fowll, MS.]`."  
"Now farewell," fayd' the kyng, "lady,  
"Ye, S.," fhe fayd', "ther is a byrd' men catt ah owll `[Sic MS.]`,  
And' yett a lady I am;"—  
"Whate is yor name, I pray you tell me?"  
"Syr kyng, I hight dame Ragneit, truly,  
That neu yett begylyd' man."  
"Dame Ragnell, nowe haue good' daye,"—  
"Syr kyng, God' fpede the on thy way,  
Ryght here I fhall the mete."  
Thus they departyd' fayre and' weit,  
The kyng full fone com to Carlyll,  
And' his hartt hevy and' greatt.  
The fyrfte man he mett was S. Gawen,  
That vnto the kyng thus gan fayn,  
"Syr, howe haue ye fped'?"  
"Forfoth," fayd' the kyng, "neu fo yll,  
Alas! I am in poynt my felf to fpyll,  
For nedely I moft be ded'."  
"Nay," fayd' Gawen, "that may nott be,  
I had' lever my felf be dead', fo mott I the,  
Thys is ill tydand'."  
"Gawen, I mett to day with the fowlyft lady  
That ev I fawe, S.tenly;  
She fayd' to me my lyfe fhe wold' faue,  
Butt fyrft fhe wold' the to husbond' haue;  
Wherfor I aim wo begon,  
Thus in my hartt I make my mone."  
"Ys this all?" theh fayd' Gawen,  
"I shall wed' her and'? wed' her agayn,  
Thowgh fhe were a fend';  
Thowgh fhe were as foull as Belfabub,  
Her fhall I wed', by the rood',  
Or elle were not I yor frende.  
For ye ar my kyng with honor,  
And' haue worfhypt me in many a ftowre,  
Therfor fhall I nott lett;  
To faue yor lyfe, lord', itt were my parte,  
Or I were `[were I, MS.]` falfe and' a greatt coward',  
And my worfhypp' is the bett."  
"I-wys, Gawen, I mett her in Inglyfwod',  
She told' me her name, by the rode,  
That itt was dame Ragnell;  
She told' me butt I had' of her anfwere,  
Elle alle my laboure is neu the nere,  
Thus fhe gaf me tell.  
And butt yf her anfwer' help me well,  
Elle lett her haue her defyre no dele,  
This was her coven‘nt;  
And' yf her anfwere help me, and' none other,  
Then wold' fhe haue you, here is alle to-geder,  
That made fhe warraunt."  
"As for this," fayd' Gawen, "[it] fhall nott lett,  
I woll wed' her at whate time ye woll fett,  
I pray you make no care;  
For and' fhe were the mofte fowlyft wygit,  
That eu men myegiit fe with fyght,  
For yor loue I woll nott fpare."  
"Garam'cy, Gawen," then fayd' kyng Arthor,  
"Of alle knygtite thou bereft the flowre,  
That eu yett I fond';  
My worfhypp' and' my lyf' thou favyft for eu,  
Therfore my loue fhall nott frome the dyffevyr,  
As I am kyng in lond'."  
Then within v. or vj. days,  
The kyng muft nedys goo his ways,  
To bere his anfwere;  
The kyng and' S. Gawen rode oute of toun,  
No man with them, butt they alone,  
Neder ferre ne nere.  
Whefi the kyng was with in the Foreft,—  
"Syr Gawen, farewell, I muft go weft,  
Thou fhalt no furder goo;"  
"My lord', God' fpede you on yor jorney,  
I wold' I fhold' nowe ryde yor way,  
For to departe I am ryght wo."  
The kyng had' rydden butt a while,  
Lytell more then the fpace of a myle,  
Or he mett dame Ragnell;—  
"A, S. kyng, ye arre nowe welcu here,  
I wott ye ryde to bere yor anfwere,  
That woll avayll you no dele."  
Nowe fayd' the kyng, "fith itt woll none other be,  
Tell me yor anfwere nowe, and' my lyfe faue me,  
Gawen fhall you wed';  
So he hath pmyfed' me my lyf' to faue,  
And' yor defyre nowe fhall ye haue,  
Both in bowre and' in bed'.  
Therfore tell me nowe alle in haft,  
Whate woll help now att laft,  
Haue done, I may nott tary;"—  
"Syr," quod' dame Ragnell, "nowe fhalt thou knowe,  
Whate wemen defyren mofte, of high and' lowe,  
From this I woll not varaye.  
Summe men fayfi, we defyre to be fayre,  
Alfo we defyre to haue repayre,  
Of diufe ftraunge men;  
Alfo we loue to haue luft in bed',  
And' often we defyre to wed',  
Thus ye mef nott ken `[Sic MS.]`.  
Yett we defyre a noder man thyng,  
To be holden nott old', but freffhe and' yong;  
With flatryng, and' glosyng, and' quaynt gyn,  
So ye men may vs wemen eu wyn,  
Of whate ye woll crave.  
Ye goo full nyfe, I wott nott lye,  
Butt there is one thyng is alle oure fantafye,  
And' that nowe fhall ye knowe;  
We defyref of men, aboue alle man thyng,  
To haue the foueynte, wtoute lefyng,  
Of alle, both hygh and' lowe.  
For where we haue foueynte alle is ourys,

And' eu the maftry wynne;  
Of the mofte manlyeft is oure defyre,  
To haue the foueynte of fuche a fyre,

Therfore wend', S. kyng, on thy way,  
And' tell that knyght, as I the faye,  
That itt is as we defyrefi mofte;  
He wol be wroth and' vnfought,  
And' curfe her faft, that itt the taught,  
For his laboure is loft.  
Go forth, S. kyng, and' hold' pmyfe,  
For thy lyfe is fure nowe in alle wyfe,  
That dare I well vndertake."  
The kyng rode forth a greatt fhake,  
As faft as he myght gate;  
Thorowe myre, more, and' fenne,  
Where as the place was fygnyd' and' fett then,  
Evyn there with S Gromy he mett.  
And' ftern worde to the king he fpak' with that,—  
"Com of, S. kyng, nowe lett fe,  
Of thyne anfwere whate itt fhal be,  
For I am redy grathyd'."  
The kyng pullyd' oute boke twayne,—  
"Syr, ther is myne anfwer', I dare fayn,  
For fomme wott help at nede."  
Syr Gromy lokyd' on theym euychon,—  
"Nay, nay, S. kyng, thou artt but a dead' mafi,  
Therfor nowe fhalt thou blede."  
"Abyde, S. Gromy," fayd' kyng Arthoure,  
"I haue one anfwere fhatt make all `[ale, MS.]` fure," —  
"Lett fe," then fayd' S. Gromy;  
"Or els, fo God' me help as I the fay,  
Thy deth thou fhalt haue wt large paye,  
I tell the nowe enfure."  
Now fayd' the kyng, "I fe, as I geffe,  
In the is butt a lytell gentilneffe,  
By God', that ay is helpand'!  
Here is oure anfwere, and' that is alle,  
That wemen defyren mofte fpeciall,  
Both of fre and' bond'.  
I faye no more, butt aboue al thyng  
Wemeh defyre fuleynte, for that is theyr lykyng,  
And' that is ther moft defyre;  
To have the rewll of the manlyeft meh,  
And' then ar they well, thus they me dyd' ken,  
To rule the, Grom' fyre."  
"And' fhe that told' the nowe, S. Arthoure,  
I pray to God', I maye fe her bren on a fyre,  
For that was my fufter dame Ragnell;  
That old' scott, God' geve her `[he MS.]` fhame!  
Elle had' I made the full tame,  
Nowe haue I loft moche travayll.  
Go where thou wolt, kyng Arthoure,  
For of me thou maifte be eu fure,  
Alas! that I eu fe this day;  
Nowe, well I wott, myne enime thou wolt be,  
An@ att fuche a pryk' fhall I ned gett the,  
My fong may be well-awaye!"  
"No," fayd' the kyng, "that make I warraunt,  
Some harnys I woll haue to make me defendaunt,  
That make I God' avowe!  
In fuche a plyght fhallt thou net me fynde,  
And' yf thou do, lett me bete and' bynde,  
As is for thy beft prouf `[prow?]`."  
"‘ Nowe haue good' day," fayd' S. Gromy,  
"Farewell," fayd' S. Arthoure, "fo mott I the,  
I am glad' I haue fo fped'."—  
King Arthoure turnyd' hys hors into the playn,  
And' fone he mett with dame Ragnelt agayn,  
In the fame place and' ftede.  
"Syr kyng, I am glad' ye haue fped' well,  
I told' howe itt wold' be, euy dell,  
Nowe hold' that ye haue hyght;  
Syn I haue fauyd' yor lyf', and' none other,  
Gawen muft me wed', S. Arthoure,  
That is a full gentill knyght."  
"No, lady, that I you hight I fhall not fayll,  
So ye wol be rulyd' by my cowncell,  
Yor will then fhall ye haue;"—  
"Nay, S. kyng, nowe woll I nott foo,  
Openly I wol be weddyd' or I parte the froo,  
Elle fhame woll ye haue.  
Ryde before, and' I woll com after,  
Vnto thy courte, S. kynge Arthoure,  
Of no man I woll fhame;  
Be-thynk' you howe I haue fauyd' yor lyf',  
Therfor with me nowe fhall ye nott ftryfe,  
For and' ye do, ye be to blame."  
The kyng of her had' greatt fhame,  
But forth fhe rood', though he were grevyd';  
Tyll they cam to Karlyle forth they mevyd'.  
In to the courte fhe rode hym by,  
For no man wold' fhe fpare, fecurly,  
Itt likyd' the kyng full yll.  
Alle the contraye had' wonder greatt,  
Fro whens fhe com, that foule vnfwete,  
They fawe neu of fo fowll a thyng;  
In to the hall fhe went, in certen,—  
"Arthoure kyng, lett fetche me S. Gaweyn,  
Before the knyghte, alle in hying.  
That I may nowe be made fekyr,  
In welle and' wo trowith plyght vs togeder,  
Before alle thy chyvalry;  
This is yor graunt, lett fe, haue done,  
Sett forth S. Gawen, my love, anon,  
For lenger tarying kepe nott I."  
Then cam forth S. Gawen the knyght,—  
"Syr, I am redy of that I you hyght,  
Alle forwarde to fulfyll;"  
"Godhauemrcy," fayd' dame Ragnell then,  
"For thy fake I wold' I were a fayre woman,  
For thou art of fo good' wyll."  
Ther S. Gawen to her his trowth plyght,  
In well and' in woo, as he was a true knyght,  
Then was dame Ragnell fayn;  
"Alas!" then fayd' dame Gaynor,  
So fayd' alle the ladyes in her bower,  
And' wept for S. Gawen.  
"Alas!" then fayd' both kyng and' knyght,  
That eu he fhold' wed' fuch a wyght,  
She was fo fowit and' horyble;  
She had' two teth on euy fyde,  
As borys tuske, I woll nott hyde,  
Of length a large handfull.  
The one tufk' went up, and the other doun,  
A mowth full wyde, and' fowll igrown,  
With grey herys many on;  
Her lyppe lay lumpryd' on her chyn,

She was a lothly on!  
She wold' nott be weddyd' in no man',  
Butt there were made a krye in alle the fhyre,    
Boti in town and' in borowe;  
Alle the ladyes nowe of the lond',

To kepe that brydalle thorowe.  
So itt befyll after on a daye,  
That maryed' fhold' be that fowll [lady |  
Vuto S. Gaweyn;  
The daye was comyn the daye fhold' be,  
Therof the ladyes had' greatt pitey,  
"Alas!" then gan they fayn.  
The queeh prayd' dame Ragnell, fekerly,  
To be maryed' in the mornyng erly,  
As pryvaly as we may;  
"Nay," fhe fayd', "by hevyn kyng!  
That woll I neu', for no thyng,  
For ought that ye can faye.  
I wol be weddyd' alle openly,  
For with the kyng fuche covern'nt made I,

And yor worfhypp' mofte;"—  
"Ye, as for that, lady, God' you fane,

I tell you withoute bofte."  
She made her redy to church to fare,  
And' alle the State that there ware,  
Syrs, withoute lefyng;  
She was arayd' in the richeft man',  
More freffher than dame Gayno'.  
Her arayment was worth iij Ml mark',  
Of good' red' nobles ftyff and' ftark',  
So rychely fhe was begon;  
For alle her rayment fhe bare the bell  
Of fowlneffe, that eu I hard' tell,  
So fowll a fowe fawe neu man.  
For to make a fhortt conclufion,  
When fhe was weddyd', they hyed' theym home,  
To mete alle they went;  
This fowll lady bygan the high defe,

So fayd' they alle, verament.  
When the fuyee cam her before,

And' opynyd' the dore full fayre;  
She ftod' in her fmok' alle by that fyre,

"Lo! this is my repayre.  
Lo!" fayd' Gawen Arthoure vntill,  
« Syr, this is my wyfe, dame Ragnell,

He told' the kyng and' the queen hem beforn,  
Howe fodenly from her fhap fhe dyd' torne,  
"My lord', nowe be yor leve."  
And' whate was the caufe fhe forfhapen was,  
Syr Gawen told' the kyng, both more and' leffe,  
"I thank' God'," fayd' the queen;  
"I wenyd', S. Gawen, fhe wold' the haue myfcaryed',  
Therfore in my hartt I was fore agrevyd',  
Butt the contrary is here feen."  
Ther was game, revell, and' playe,  
And' euy man to other gan faye,  
"She is a fayre wyght;"  
Than the kyng theym alle gan tell,  
How did' held' hym att nede dame Ragnell,  
"Or my deth had' bene dyght."  
Ther the kyng told' the queen, by the rood',  
Howe he was beftad' in Inglefwod',

And' whate othe the kngyht made hym fwere,  
"Or elle he had' slay me ryght there,  
Wtoute m'cy or mefure.  
This fame lady, dame Ragnell,  
From my det fhe dyd' help me ryght well,  
Alle for the love of Gawen;"—  
The Gawen told' the king alle to-geder,  
Howe forfhapen fhe was with her ftepmoder  
Tyll a knyght had' holpen her agayf.  
Ther fhe told' the kyng fayre and' well,  
How Gawen gave her the foueynte euy dell,  
And' whate choyfe fhe gave to hym;—  
"God' thank' hym of his curtesye,  
He favid' me from chaunce and' vilony,  
That was full foull and' grym.  
Therfore, curteys knyght and' hend' Gawen,

"Garam'cy, lady," then fayd' Gawen,  
"Wt you I hold' me full well content,  
And' that I truft to fynde;'—  
He fayd', "my loue fhall fhe haue,  
Therafter nede fhe neu more craue,  
For fhe hath bene to me fo kynde."  
The queen fayd', and' the ladyes alle,  
"She is the fayreft nowe in this halle,  
I fwere by Seynt John !—  
My loue, lady, ye fhall haue eu,  
For that ye favid' my lord' Arthoure,  
As I am a gentilwoman."  
Syr Gawen gatt on her Gyngolyn,  
That was a good' knygiit of strength and' kyng,  
And' of the Table Round';  
Att euy greatt feft that lady fhold' be,  
Of fayrneffe fhe bare away the bewtye,  
Wher fhe yed' oft the ground'.  
Gawen louyd' that lady, dame Ragnell,  
In alle his lyfe he louyd' none fo well,  
I tell you, withoute lefyng;  
As a coward' he lay by her both day and' nyght,  
Neu wold' he haunt justyng aryght,  
Ther att m'vaylyd' Arthoure the kyng `[kyng Arthoure, MS.]`.  
She prayd' the kyng, for his gentilnes,  
To be good' lord' to S. Gromy i-wyffe,  
Of that to you he hath offendyd';—  
"Yes, lady, that shall I nowe, for yor fake,  
For I wott well he may nott amende make,  
He dyd' to me full vnhend'."  
Nowe for to make you a fhort conclufyoh,  
I caft me for to make ah end' full fone,  
Of this gentyll lady;  
She lyvyd' with S. Gawen butt yerys v.  
That grevyd' Gawen alle his lyfe,  
I tell you, fecurly.  
In her lyfe fhe grevyd' hym neu,  
Therfor was neu woman to hym lever,  
Thus leves my talkyng;  
She was the fayreft lady of all `[ale, MS.]` Englond',  
When fhe was on Iyve, I vnderstond',  
So fayd' Arthoure the kyng.  
Thus endyth the aduenture of kyng Arthoure,  
That oft in his days was grevyd' fore,  
And' of the weddyng of Gawen;  
Gawen was weddyd' oft in his days,  
Butt fo well he net lovyd' woman always,  
As I haue hard' men fayn.  
This aduenture befell in Inglefwod',  
As good' kynge Arthoure of huntyng yod',  
Thus haue I hard' men tell;  
Nowe, God', as thou were in Bethleme born,  
Suffer neu her foules be forlorne,  
In the brynnyng fyre of hell!  
And', Ihu, as thou were borne of a virgyn,  
Help hym oute of forowe, that this tale dyd' devyne,  
And' that nowe in alle haft;  
For he is be-fett with gaylours many,  
That kepeh hym full fewerly,  
With wyles wrong & wrafte.  
Nowe, God', as thou art veray kyng ryoall,  
Help hym oute of daunger that made this tale,  
For therin he hath bene long;  
And' of greatt pety help thy funt,  
For body & foull I yeld' into thyne hand',  
For paynes he hath ftrong.

*Here endyth the weddyng of Syr Gawen and Dame Ragnell, for helpyng of Kyng Arthoure.*

Marriage of Sir Gawaine.

THIS fragment is borrowed from the text of the Percy Manuscript, as given in the *"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,"* vol. iii. p. 350, edit. 1794. Dr. Percy supplied the deficiencies in a very ingenious manner, and inserted the ballad thus amended in the first edition of his collection, 8vo, 1764, and repeated it in all subsequent impressions; but this mode of editing ancient poetry having justly been blamed by Ritson and Pinkerton, the Bishop in the fourth edition annexed the fragment, "with all its defects, inaccuracies and errata," in order to show the state of the poem in the MS. Ritson reprinted the genuine and the *amended* texts in parallel columns in the Dissertation prefixed to his *Metrical Romances*, 8vo, 1802, p. ex, and the ballad in its improved form was introduced also by Lewis into his *Tales of Wonder*, vol. ii. p. 362, 8vo, 1802. The Bishop was of opinion that this poem was more ancient than the time of Chaucer, and that he borrowed from it his *Wife of Bathe's tale* (See *Cambro-Briton*, vol. i. p. 256, 8vo, 1820); and Sir Walter Scott in a letter to George Ellis writes, that the tale of Sir Gawayne’s Foul Lady is originally Scaldic, as appears in the history of Hrolf Kraka, edited py Torfzeus, 12mo, Havn. 1715, cap. vii. (*Life*, by Lockhart, vol.i. p. 334.) The passage itself is quoted from the *Saga* by Scott in his *Border Minstrelsy*, vol. ii. p. 140, in illustration of the old Scotish ballad of King Henrie, which preserves very remarkably the legend of the Scandinavian monarch, Helgius.

Warton says in a note to his *"History of English Poetry,"* vol. ii. p. 41, ed. 1894, "I must not forget here, that Sir Gawaine, one of Arthur's champions, is celebrated in a separate romance. Among Tanner’s Manuscripts we have *The Weddynge of Sir Gawaine*, Numb. 455, Bibl. Bodl. It begins, ‘ Be ye blythe, and listeneth to the lyf of a lorde riche.’" It would have given me much pleasure to have included this romance in the present volume, but Warton’s reference is erroneous, and although the Rev. Dr. Bandinel with the greatest courtesy undertook a minute and laborious search for the poem in question, it was without success. Warton’s notorious inaccuracy in matters of this sort forms a sad blot in his otherwise very useful and entertaining work, of which a *critical* edition is still much desiderated.

P. 289, 1.32. *Tearne-wadling.*

See previous Note, in p. 330. `[P. 95, st.i.1.2. By the Terne Wahethelyne. This is still the name of a small tarn or lake, which covers about an hundred acres of land in the forest of Inglewood, near Hesketh in Cumberland. Towards the north-east end were the remains, in 1794, of an ancient castle, called popularly Castle Hewin. Hutchinson’s Cumberland, i. 491. The spot is again alluded to in the romance-tale or ballad on the Marriage of Sir Gawayne, printed by Percy, Reliques, iii. 351, ed. 1794, and reprinted in the Appendix to the present volume. Consult Ritson’s King Arthur, p. 93.]`

P. 293, 1. 116. *Sir Lancelott and Sir Steven bold.*

The name of the second of these champions does not occur in the Round Table romances.

*Ibid.* 1. 120.  
*Soe did Sir Banier and Str Bore,*  
*Sir Garrett with them, soe gay.*

*Banier* is probably a mistake for *Beduer*, the king’s constable. Sir *Bore* is Bors de Gauves. (See previous Note, p. 313.) Sir *Garett* is *Gareth* or *Gaheriet*, the younger brother of Sir Gawayne; and his adventures, under the surname of *Beaumayns*, occupy an entire book,—the seventh,—in the *Morte d’ Arthur*, vol. i. pp. 186-245. He took the part of Lancelot against his brothers, but was accidentally killed by him on the occasion of the rescue of queen Guenever. *Ibid.* vol. ii. p. 403. Revenge for his loss prompted Sir Gawayne to induce king Arthur to cross the sea to attack Lancelot, which ultimately proved the destruction of the whole of the *Table Ronde*. Sir Walter Scott in a Note on *Sir Tristrem*, p. 379, ed. 1833, quotes a "romance of Sir *Gaheret*," in which the knight plays at chess with a beautiful fairy, [Floribelle, a *suivante* of the fairy Morgana, ] and is vanquished, but is afterwards liberated from his confinement by his cousin [brother] Gawayne, who wins the game by a move long afterwards called *l’échec de Gauvain*, and now *léchec du berger*, or fool's-mate. In reality there is no such romance, but the adventure here alluded to occurs in an episodical tale of Gawayne and his three brothers, analysed in the *Bibliotheque des Romans, Juillet*, 1777, pp. 87-122. I may here venture to correct another venial error of Scott, who in the same work, p. 416, quotes from Gower the lines,

There was Tristrem, which was beloved  
With bele Isolde; and Lancelot  
Stode with Guenor, and *Galahote*  
With his lady.

Sir Walter argues, that Gower is here incorrect, since *Galahaut* or *Galahad* had no paramour. But Gower is perfectly accurate, and alludes to *Gallehault*, king of the *loingtaines isles* or *de oultre les marches*, whose mistress was Malchault, lady in attendance on queen Guenever, and by whose instrumentality the intrigue of Lancelot with her mistress was brought about. See the *Roman de Lancelot*, vol. i. ff. lxxxiii-v, edit. 1513. Scott confounds this *Gallehault* with *Galaad*, the immaculate son of Lancelot, who accomplished the adventure of the Sangreal.

The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell

ARTHUR, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure, `[Sir Gromer occurs in "The Turke and Gowin," Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, i., 102; Sir Grummore Grummorsum, "a good knight of Scotland," in Morte d' Arthur ed. Wright, i., 286, and elsewhere. Madden.]` who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but after a while he took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in different directions, put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should help at need.

Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady riding on a richly caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur, and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain's wife. The king said this lay with Gawain; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. "No matter," she rejoined, "though I be foul, choice for a mate hath an owl. "When thou comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost."

The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man he saw was Gawain, who asked him how he had sped. Never so ill; he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. "Is that all?" said Gawain. "I will wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no friend." Well might the king exclaim, "Of all knights thou bearest the flower!"

After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded her answer. "Some say this, and some say that, but above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; `[See Note at the end of this paper: "Women desire Sovereignty."]` tell this to the knight; he will curse her that told thee, for his labour is lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could. "Nay, nay, king," said Grorner, "thou art but a dead man." "Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire sovereignty."

"She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell. I pray, I may see her burn on a fire." And so they parted.

Dame Ragnell was also waiting for Arthur, and would hear of nothing but immediate fulfilment of her bargain. She followed the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person: she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats all that was set before her, less and more.

A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. "I will do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would not hold: he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul by day, or fair by day and foul by night. `[]` Gawain said the choice was hard, and left all to her. "Gramercy," said the lady, "thou shalt have me fair both day and night." Then she told him that her step-dame had turned her into that monstrous shape by necromancy, not to recover her own till the best knight in England had wedded her and given her sovereignty in all points.

A charming little scene follows, in which Arthur visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the fiend may have slain him.

1 This is the scene in the bridal chamber next morning:

[715] I telle you, in certeyne,
Withe joye & myrthe they wakyde tylle daye,
And thane wolde rise that fayre maye, `[mayd, MS.]`
'Ye shalle nott.' sir Gawene sayde;
'We wolle lye, & slepe tylle pryme,
[720] And thene lett the kyng calle vs to dyne.'
'I ame greed,' then sayde the mayde.
Thus itt passyde forth tylle mid-daye.
'Syrs,' `[Syr, MS.]` quode the kyng, 'lett vs go ande asaye,
Yf sir Gawene be one lyve.
[725] I ame fulle ferde of sir Gawene
Nowe, lest the fende haue hyme slayne;
Nowe wolde I fayne preve.
Go we nowe,' sayde Arthoure the kyng,
'We wolle go se theyr vprysing,
[730] How welle that he hathe spede.'
They came to the chambre, alle in certeyne;
'Aryse,' sayde the kyng to sir Gawene,
'Why slepyst thou so long in bede?'
'Mary,' quode Gawene, 'sir kyng, sicurly,
[735] I wolde be glade ande ye wolde lett me be,
For I am fulle welle att eas;
Abyde, ye shalle se the dore vndone,

[740] Sir Gawene rose, ande in his hande he toke
His fayr lady, ande to the dore he shoke,
Ande opynyde the dore fulle fayre;
She stode in her smoke alle by that syre,
Her her `[ hed, MS.]` was to her knees as rede as golde wyre,
745 'Lo! this is my repayre.

'Syr, this is my wife, dame Ragnelle,

He tolde the kyng and the queene heme beforne,

'My lorde, nowe be yowr leve.'
Ande whate was the cause she forshapene was,

On this ballad, Sir F. Madden suggests, was founded that of the "Marriage of Sir Gawaine," which Percy printed, supplying from conjecture the _lacunae_, in the first edition of his _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_, 1765, and the two subsequent editions. It is thus given in the _Percy Folio MS._, edited by Drs. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i., and reproduced by Prof. Child:

**The Marriage of Sir Gawaine**

`[King Arthur is at Carlisle, keeping a merry Christmas.]`

[1] Kinge Arthur liues in merry Carlisle,  
And seemely is to see,  
And there he hath with him Queene Genever,  
That bride soe bright of blee.

[2] And there he hath with him Queene Genever,  
That bride soe bright in bower,  
And all his barons about him stoode,  
That were both stiffe and stowre.

[3] The king kept a royall Christmasse,  
Of mirth and great honor,  
And when ...

---

`['And for ransom bring me word what is the great desire of women.' Arthur agrees to these terms, and goes back to Carlisle, moaning. Arthir tells Gawain of his encounter with the Baron at Tearne Wadling, and that to get of fighting him, he must find out, by New Year's Day, what a woman most desires. Arthur sets forth to fulfil his engagement. Crossing a moor, he sees a very hideous lady,]`

[4] 'And bring me word what thing it is  
That a woman [doth] most desire;  
This shall be thy ransome, Arthur, he sayes,  
For he haue noe other hier.'

[5] King Arthur then held vp his hand,  
According thene as was the law;  
He tooke his leaue of the baron there,  
And hoinward can `['gan, began.]` he draw.

[6] And when he came to merry Carlile,  
To his chamber he is gone,  
And ther came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
As he did make his mone.

[7] And there came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
That was a curteous knight;  
Why sigh you soe sore, vncle Arthur,' he said,
'Or who hath done thee vnright?'

[8] 'O peace, O peace, thou gentle Gawaine,  
That faire may thee beffall!  
For if thou knew my sighing soe deepe,  
Thou wold not meruaile att all.

[9] 'Ffor when I came to Tearne Wadling, `[A town in Inglewond Forest, near Hesketh, in CunilxTland; sometimes written Tearne Wathelyne.]`  
A bold barron there I fand,  
With a great club vpon his backe,  
Standing stiife and strong.

[10] 'And he asked me wether I wold fight  
Or from him I shold begone,  
O[r] else I must him a ransome pay,  
And soe depart him from.

[11] 'To fight with him I saw noe cause;  
Methought it was not meet;  
For he was stiffe and strong with-all,  
His strokes were nothing sweete.

[12] 'Therefor this is my ransome, Gawaine,  
I ought to him to pay;  
I must come againe, as I am sworne,  
Vpon the New Yeers day;

[13] 'And I must bring him word what thing it is  
[That a woman doth most desire.]

---

[14] Then king Arthur drest him for to ryde,  
In one soe rich array,  
Toward the fore-said Tearne Wadling,  
Thai he might keepe his day.

[15] And as he rode over a more,  
Hee see a lady where shee sate  
Betwixt an oke and a greene hollen;  
She was cladd in red Scarlett. `[This was a common phrase in our old writers: so Chaucer, in his Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, says of the Wife of Bath: "Her hosen were of fyne scarlet red." — Percy.]`

`[with one eye instead of her mouth, and a crooked pose. She asks, 'Who are you? Fear not me. Perhaps I may succour you.' 'Succour me, and Gawain shall marry you.']`

[16] Then there as shold haue stood her mouth,  
Then there was sett her eye;  
The other was in her forhead fast,  
The way that she might see.

[17] Her nose was crooked and turnd outward,  
Her mouth stood foule a-wry;  
A worse formed lady than shee was,  
Neuer man saw with his eye.

[18] To halch vpon him, King Arthur,  
This lady was full faine,  
But King Arthur had forgott his lesson  
What he shold say againe.

[19] 'What knight art thou,' the lady sayd,  
That will not speak to me?  
Of me be thou nothing dismayd,  
Tho I be vgly to see.

[20] For I haue halched you curteouslye,  
And you will not me againe;  
Yett I may happen, Sir Knight,' shee said,  
To ease thee of thy paine.'

[21] 'Giue thou ease me, lady,' he said,  
Or helpe me in any thing,  
Thou shalt have gentle Gawaine, my cozen,  
And marry him with a ring.'

[22] 'Why, if I help thee not, thou noble King Arthur,  
Of thy owne hearts desiringe,  
Of gentle Gawaine ....

`[At the tarn he finds the Baron, who thinks Arthur cannot produce the ransom or answer, and claims him and his land. Arthur bids him wait a bit, then gives the answer: 'A woman will have her will.' The Baron curses the lady (his sister, it turns out).]`

[23] And when he came to the Tearne Wadling,  
The baron there cold he finde,  
With a great weapon on his backe,  
Standing stiffe and stronge.

[24] And then he tooke 'King Arthur's letters in his hands,  
And away he cold them fling,  
And then he puld out a good browne sword,  
And cryd himselfe a king.

[25] And he sayd, 'I have thee and thy land, Arthur,  
To doe as it pleaseth me,  
For this is not thy ransome sure,  
Therfore yeeld thee to me.'

[26] And then bespoke him noble Arthur,  
And bad him hold his hand:  
And giue me leaue to speake my mind  
In defence of all my land.'

[27] He said, 'As I came over a more,  
I see a lady where shee sate  
Betweene an oke and a green hollen;  
Shee was clad in red scarlett.

[28] 'And she says a woman will haue her will,  
And this is all her cheef desire:  
Doe me right, as thou art a baron of sckill,  
This is thy ransome and all thy hyer.'

[29] He sayes, 'An early vengeance light on her!  
She walkes on yonder more;  
It was my sister that told thee this,  
And she is a misshappen hore.

[30] 'But heer Ile make mine avow to God  
To doe her an euill turne,  
For an euer I may thate fowle theefe get,  
In a fyer I will her burne.'

---

`[A company of knights, riding out with the King and Sir Gawain meet the hag. Sir Kay does not fancy her to kiss. Sir Gawain bids him to be quiet, for one of them  must have her to wife. Sir Kay says he had rather perish than it should be he. The others are of the same mind. Arthur reproves his knights.]`

[31] Sir Lancelott and Sir Steven bold, `[Sir Steven does not occur (says Madden) in the Round Table romances.]`  
They rode with them that day,  
And the formost of the company  
There rode the steward Kay.

[32] Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,  
Sir Garrett `[Banier, probably, according to the same authority, a mistake for Bediuer, the King's Constable — Tennyson's Bedivere. Bore is Bors de Gaunes (or Gannes), brother of Lionel. Garrett is Gareth, or Gaheriet, Sir Gawaine's younger brother. Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall.]` with them soe gay,  
Soe did Sir Tristeraru, thai gentle knight,  
To the forrest fresh and gay.

[33] And when he came to the greene forrest,  
Vnderneath a greene holly tree,  
Their sate that lady in red scarlet  
That vnseemly was to see.

[34] Sir Kay beheld this ladys face,  
And looked vppon her swire;  
Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he sayes,  
Of his kisse he stands in feare,'

[35] Sir Kay beheld the lady againe,  
And looked vpon her snout;  
Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he sayes,  
Of his kisse he stands in doubt.'

[36] 'Peace, cozen Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
Amend thee of thy life;
For there is a knight amongst vs all,  
That must marry her to his wife.'

[37] 'What! wedd her to wiffe!' then said Sir Kay,  
In the diuells name anon!  
Gett me a wiffe where-ere I may,  
For I had rather be slaine!'

[38] Then some tooke vp their hawkes in hast,  
And some tooke vp their hounds,  
And some sware they wold not marry her  
For citty nor for towne.

[39] And then be-spake him noble King Arthur,  
And sware there by this day,  
'For a litle foule sight and misliking

`[Gawain's bride asks whether her foul by day or night. Gawain answers, 'By day.' 'Then i must hide from your companions.' 'No; do as you like.' 'Bless you, Gawain, you have cured me. I was witched into the likeness of a fiend.']`

[40] Then shee said, 'Choose thee, gentle Gawaine,  
Truth as I doe say, win have her foul
Wether thou wilt haue me in this liknesse  
In the night or else in the day.'

[41] And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Was one soe mild of moode,  
Sayes, 'Well I know what I wold say,  
God grant it may be good!

[42] 'To haue thee fowle in the night  
When I with thee shold play  
Yet I had rather, if I might,  
Haue thee fowle in the day.'

[43] 'What! when lords goe with ther feires,' shee said  
'Both to the ale and wine,  
Alas! then I must hyde my selfe,  
I must not goe withinne.'

[44] And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Said, 'Lady, that's but skill;  
And because thou art my owne lady  
Thou shalt haue all thy will.'

[45] Then she said, 'Blessed be thou, gentle Gawaine,  
This day that I thee see,  
For as thou seest me att this time,  
From hencforth I wilbe.

[46] 'My father was an old knight,  
And yet it chanced soe  
That he marryed a younge lady  
That brought me to this woe.

[47] 'Shee witched me, being a faire young lady,  
To the greene forrest to dwell,  
And there I must walke in womans liknesse,  
Most like a feend of hell.

[48] 'She witch my brother to a carlisli b . . .

`['Kiss her, brother Kay', says Gawain, 'and regret your rudeness'. Kay kisses her, and congratulates Gawain. He and Kay take the lady between them, and lead her to King Arthur who thanks God for Gawain's bliss. All the knights rejoice.]`

[49] . . .
. . .
That looked soe foule, and that was wont  
On the wild more to goe.'

[50] 'Come kisse her, brother Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
And amend thé of thy liffe;  
I sweare this is the same lady  
That I marryed to my wiffe.'

[51] 'Sir [Kay he] kissed that lady bright,  
Standing vpon his ffeete;  
He swore, as he was trew knight,  
The spice was neuer soe svveete.

[52] 'Well, cozen Gawaine,' sayes Sir Kay,  
Thy chance is fallen arright,  
For thou hast gotten one of the fairest maids,  
I euer saw with my sight.'

[53] 'It is my fortune,' said Sir Gawaine;  
For my vncle Arthurs sake  
I am glad as grasse wold be of raine,  
Great ioy that I may take.'

[54] Sir Gawaine tooke the lady by the one arme,  
them, Sir Kay tooke her by the tother,  
They led her straight to King Arthur,  
As they were brother and brother.

[55] King Arthur welcomed them there all,  
And soe did Lady Geneuer his queene,  
With all the knights of the Round Table,  
Most seemly to be seene.

[56] King Arthur beheld that lady faire  
That was soe faire and bright,  
He thanked Christ in Trinity  
For Sir Gawame, that gentle knight.

[57] Soe did the knights, both more and lesse,  
All the knights rejoice.
Rejoyced all that day  
For the good chance that happened was  
To Sir Gawaine and his lady gay.

CHAPTER 6 — GAWAIN

...

The last poem of this group is _The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell_, originally 925 lines in length. `[A leaf is wanting in the unique MS.]` It is in the South Midland dialect of about 1450. As in so many of these poems it opens with a hunting expedition by Arthur. He parts company with the others to pursue a giant hart, and meets a knight named Sir Gromersomer Joure, who claims that his lands have been wrongfully given to Sir Gawain, and says that he will kill Arthur unless he finds out within a year what women most desire. Arthur has to promise to return, and sets about finding the required answer. He is given enough different replies to fill a large volume; but on the day before his appointment with Gromersomer Joure he meets a hideous hag who tells him that she alone knows the correct one, which she will give him on condition that she may wed Gawain. The King says that he will ask Gawain, who agrees without hesitation. The hag, by name Dame Ragnell, then informs Arthur that women most desire ‘to have the sovereignty'. She will only hold him to the bargain if this is the right answer. Having tried all the other replies, Arthur finally gives Gromersomer Joure that of the hag, which is indeed correct. Gawain has to wed her, to the sorrow of the court, even though he seems cheerful enough. At the wedding feast Ragnell disgusts everyone by eating as much as six men. They retire to bed, and Ragnell demands a kiss from her husband. It is given and she turns into a beautiful maiden, who says that she may be like this either by day or night, according to his choice. Gawain, in accordance with the answer she had given Arthur earlier, puts the matter in her hands, and as a result is told that she will always retain her new form.

This story, of the loathly bride who must win a handsome husband in order to be freed from a spell, is one of the commonest of folk-tales. An Irish version occurs in the twelfth-century Book of Ballynote; the present version may have been Scandinavian in origin, or have been influenced by Scandinavian tales, especially in the detail of the bride's grotesque appetite.

Other English tellings of it are to be found in Gower's Confessio Amantis, and in The Wife of Bath's Tale. The Chaucerian version is probably the best-known of the three, but has the least connections with Arthur. The introduction would appear to show that Chaucer knew the story on which The Gest of Sir Gawain was based; for the main story, he used, with free adaptations, an earlier version of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_. It is the rape of Brandelis's sister which is the central incident of The Gest of Sir Gawain that causes the question: ‘What do women most desire?' Gawain is fittingly punished by having to marry the hideous hag who provides the answer. The feast, obviously in Chaucer's original, is omitted, with the remark that there was no feasting on such a sad occasion. And the final choice is very different: Gawain's bride can either remain hideous and be faithful to her husband, or he can have her beautiful and take his chance. By giving her the choice, he gets her both beautiful and faithful.

Both this free version, and the rather closer one of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_ come from a common original in which Gawain was hero, since Chaucer is unlikely to have added an Arthurian background, and yet, because of the discrepancy in dates, cannot have used the present version of The Wedding. Malory must have known either this or its predecessor, for he mentions Sir Gromersomer Joure. `[Identical with Sir Grummor Grummorson.]`

There is little remarkable in the poem's style, which is very much inferior to _The Wife of Bath's Tale_, although less crude and grotesque than the other works of the ‘primitive' group. Had the Chaucerian version stronger associations with Arthurian literature, it would rank as second only to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. As it is, it hardly falls within our scope, having no more than a name or two and half a dozen lines of introduction to identify it with Arthur and his court.

THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE.

From "Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry".

PART I.

King Arthur lives in merry Carleile,  
And seemely is to see;  
And there with him Queene Guenever,  
That bride soe bright of blee.

And there with him Queene Guenever,  
That bride so bright in bowre:  
And all his barons about him stoode,  
That were both stiffe and stowre.

The King a royale Christmasse kept,  
With mirth and princelye cheare;  
To him repaired many a knighte,  
That came both farre and neare.

And when they were to dinner sette,  
And cups went freely round;  
Before them came a faire damselle,  
And knelt upon the ground.

—" A boone, a boone, O kinge Arthure,  
"I beg a boone of thee;  
"Avenge me of a carlish knighte,  
"Who hath shent my love and mee.

"At Tearne-Wadling `[Tearne-Wadling is the name of a small lake near Hasketh in Cumberland, on the road from Penrith to Carlisle. There is a tradition, that an old castle once stood near the lake, the remains of which were not long since visible. Tearh, in the dialect of that country, signifies a small lake, and is still in use. ]` his castle stands,  
"Near to that lake so fair,  
"And proudlye rise the battlements,  
"And streamers deck the air.

"Noe gentle knighte, nor ladye gay,  
"May pass that castle-walle:  
"But from that foule discurteous knighte,  
"Mishappe will them befalle.

"Hee's twyce the size of common men,  
"Wi' thewes, and sinewes stronge,  
"And on his backe he bears a clubbe,  
"That is both thicke and longe.

"This grim me Barone 'twas our harde happe,  
"But yester morne to see;  
"When to his bowre he bare my love,  
"And sore misused mee.

"And when I told him, King Arthure  
"As lyttle shold him spare;  
"Goe tell, say'd hee, that cuckold kinge,  
"To meete mee if he dare" —

Upp then sterted King Arthure,  
And sware by hille and dale,  
He ne'er wolde quitt that grimme Barone,  
Till he had made him quail.

"Goe fetch my sword Excalibar:  
"Goe saddle mee my steede;  
"Nowe, by my faye, that grimme Barone  
"Shall rue this ruthfuUe deede.

And when he came to Tearne-Wadlinge  
Benethe the castle walk:  
"Come forth; come forth; thou proude Barone,  
"Or yielde thyself my thralle."

On magicke grounde that castle stoode,  
And fenced with many a spelle:  
Noe valiant knighte could tread thereon,  
But straite his courage felle.

Forth then rush'd that carlish Knight,  
King Arthure felte the charme:  
His sturdy sinewes lost their strengthe,  
Downe sunke his. feeble arme.

— "Nowe yield thee, yield thee, Kinge Arthure,  
"Now yield thee unto mee;  
"Or fighte with mee, or lose thy lande,  
"Noe better termes maye bee.

"Unlesse thou sweare upon the rood,  
"And promise on thy faye,  
"Here to returne to Tearne-Wadling,  
"Upon the new-yeare's daye;

"And bringe me worde what thing it is  
"All women moste desyre;  
"This is thy ransome, Arthur" he sayes,  
"He have noe other hyre." —

King Arthur then helde up his hande,  
And sware upon his faye,  
Then took his leave of the grimme Barone  
And faste hee rode awaye.

And he rode east, and he rode west,  
And did of all inquyre,  
What thing it is all women crave,  
And what they most desyre.

Some told him riches, pompe, or state;  
Some rayment fine and brighte;  
Some told him mirthe; some flatterye;  
And some a jollye knighte.

In letters all King Arthur wrote,  
And seal'd them with his ringe:  
But still his minde was helde in doubte,  
Each tolde a different thinge.

As ruthfulle he lode over a more,  
He saw a Ladye sette  
Betweene an oke, and a greene holleye,  
All clad in red scarlette.

Her nose was crookt and turnd outwarde,  
Her chin stoode all awrye;  
And where as sholde have been her mouthe,  
Lo! there was set her eye;

Her haires, like serpents, clung aboute  
Her cheekes of deadlye hewe:  
A worse-form'd ladye than she was,  
No man mote ever viewe.

To hail the King in seemelye sorte  
This ladye was fulle faine;  
But King Arthure all sore amaz'd,  
No aunswere made againe.

— "What wight art thou," the Ladye say'd,  
"That wilt not speake to mee;  
"Sir, I may chance to ease thy paine,  
"Though I bee Joule to see.

— "If thou wilt ease my paine," he sayd,  
"And helpe me in my neede;  
"Ask what thou wilt, thou grimme Ladye,  
"And it shall bee thy meede." —

— "O sweare mee this upon the roode,  
"And promise on thy faye;  
"And here the secrette I will telle,  
"That shall thy ransome paye" —

King Arthur promised on his faye,  
And sware upon the roode:  
The secrette then the Ladye told,  
As lightlye well she cou'de.

— "Now this shall be my paye," sir King,  
"And this my guerdon bee,  
"That some yong fair and courtlye knight,  
"Thou bringe to marrye mee," —

Fast then pricked King Arthure  
Ore hille, and dale, and downe:  
And soone he founde the Barone's bowre,  
And soone the grimme Baroune.  

He bare his clubbe upon his backe,  
Hee stoode bothe stiffe and stronge;  
And, when he had the letters reade,  
Awaye the letters flunge.

— "Nowe yielde thee, Arthur, and thy lands,  
"All forfeit unto mee;  
"For this is not thy paye, sir King,  
"Nor may thy ransome bee." —

— "Yet hold thy hand, thou proud Barone,  
"I praye thee hold thy hand;  
"And give mee leave to speake once more  
"In reskewe of my land.

"This morne, as I came over a more,  
"I saw a Ladye sette  
"Betwene an oke, and a greene holleye,  
"All clad in red scarlette;

"She sayes, all women will have their wille,  
"This is their chief desyre;  
"Now yield, as thou art a Barone true,  
"That I have payd mine hyre."

— "An earlye vengeaunce light on her!"  
The carlish Baron swore:  
"Shee was my sister tolde thee this,  
"And shee's a misshapen whore.

"But here I will make mine avowe,  
"To do her as ill a turne:  
"For an ever I may that foule theefe gette,  
"In a fyre 1 will her burne"—

PART II.

Homewarde pricked King Arthure,  
And a wearye man was hee;  
And soone he mette Queene Guenever,  
That bride so bright of blee.  

— "What newes I what newes I thou noble King,  
"Howe, Arthur, hast thou sped?  
"Where hast thou hung the carlish Knighte?  
"And where bestow'd his head?" —

— "The carlish Knight is safe for mee,  
"And free fro mortal harme:  
"On magicke grounde his castle stands,  
"And fenced with many a charme.

"To bowe to him I was fulle faine,  
"And yielde mee to his hand;  
"And but for a lothly Ladye, there  
"I sholde have lost my land.  

"And nowe this fills my hearte with woe,  
"And sorrowe of my life;  
"I swore a yonge and courtlye knight,  
"Sholde marry her to his wife." —  

Then bespake him Sir Gawaine,  
That was ever a gentle knighte:  
— "That lothly Ladye I will wed;  
"Therefore be merrye and lighte"—

— "Nowe naye, nowe naye, good Sir Gawaine;  
"My sister's sonne yee bee;  
"This lothlye Ladye's all too grirame,  
"And all too foule for yee.

"Her nose is crookt, and turn'd outwardc;  
"Her chin stands all awrye;  
"A worse form'd ladye than shee is  
"Was never seen with eye." —

— "What though her chin stand all awrye,  
"And shee be foule to see:  
"I'll marry her, unkle, for thy sake,  
"And I'll thy ransome bee."—

— "Nowe thankes, nowe thankes, good Sir Gawaine;  
"And a blessing thee betyde!  
"To-morrow wee'll have knights and squires,  
"And wee'll goe fetch thy bride.

"And wee'll have hawkes, and wee'll have houndes,  
"To cover our intent;  
"And wee'll away to the greene forest,  
"As wee a hunting went—

Sir Lancelot, Sir Stephen bolde,  
They rode with them that daye;  
And foremoste of the companye  
There rode the stewarde Kaye:

Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,  
And eke Sir Garratte keene;  
Sir Tristram too, that gentle knight,  
To the forest freshe and greene.

And when they came to the greene forrest,  
Beneathe a faire holley tree,  
There sate that Ladye in red scarlette  
That unseemelye was to see.

Sir Kay beheld that Lady's face,  
And looked upon her sweere;  
— "Whoever kisses that Ladye," he sayes,  
"Of his kisse he stands in feare." —

Sir Kay beheld that Ladye againe,  
And looked upon her snout;  
— "Whoever kisses that Ladye," he sayes,  
"Of his kisse he stands in doubt" —

— "Peace, brother Kay," sayde Sir Gawaine,  
"And amend thee of thy life;  
"For there is a Knight amongst us all,  
"Must marry her to his wife,"-—

— "What, marry this foule queane," quoth Kay,  
"I' the devils name anone;  
"Gett mee a wife wherever I maye,  
"In sooth shee shall be none,"—

Then some tooke up their hawkes in haste,  
And some tooke up their houndes;  
And sayd they wolde not many her,  
For cities, nor for townes.

Then bespake him King Arthure,  
And sware there by this daye;  
—" For a little foule sighte and mislikinge,  
"Yee shall not say her naye." —

— "Peace, Lordings, peace;" Sir Gawaine sayd;  
"Nor make debate and strife;  
"This lothlye Ladye I will take,  
"And marry her to my wife"—

-— "Nowe thankes, nowe thankes, good Sir Gawaine,  
"And a blessinge be thy meede!  
"For as I am thine owne ladye,  
"Thou never shalt rue this deede." —

Then up they took that lothly Dame,  
And home anone they bringe:  
And there Sir Gawaine he her wed,  
And married her with a ringe.

And when they were in wed-bed laid,  
And all were done awaye:  
— "Come turne to mee, mine owne wed-lord,  
"Come turne to mee I praye." —

Sir Gawaine scant could lift his head,  
For sorrowe and for care;  
When, lo I instead of (hat lothelye Dame,  
Hee sawe a young Ladye faire.

Sweet blushes stayned her rud-red cheeke,  
Her eyen were blacke as sloe:  
The ripening cherrye swellde her lippe,  
And all her necke was snowe.

Sir Gawaine kiss'd that Lady faire,  
Lying upon the sheete:  
And swore, as he was a true Knighte,  
The spice was never soe sweete.

Sir Gawaine kiss'd that Lady brighter  
Lying there by his side:  
— "The fairest flower is not soe faire:  
"Thou never can st bee my bride."—

— "I am thy bride, mine owne deare Lorde,  
"The same whiche thou didst knowe,  
"That was soe lothlye, and was wont  
"Upon the wild more to goe.

"Nowe, gentle Gawaine, chuse," quoth shee,  
"And make thy choice with care;  
"Whether by night, or else by daye,  
"Shall I be foule or faire?" —

— "To have thee foule still in the night,  
"When I with thee should playe!  
"I had rather farre, my lady deare,  
"To have thee foule by daye."—

— "What, when gaye ladyes goe with their lordes  
"To drinke the ale and wine;  
"Alas I then I must hide myself,  
"I must not goe with mine?"—

— "My faire ladye," Sir Gawaine sayd,  
"I yield me to thy skille;  
"Because thou art mine owne ladye  
"Thou shalt have all thy wille." —

— "Nowe blessed be thou, sweete Gawaine,  
"And the daye that I thee see;  
"For as thou seest mee at this time,  
"See shall I ever bee.  

"My father was an aged knighte,  
"And yet it chanced soe,  
"He tooke to wife a false ladye,  
"Whiche broughte me to this woe.  

"Shee witch'd mee, being a faire yonge maide,  
"In the greene forest to dwelle;  
"And there to abyde in lothlye shape,  
"Most like a fiend of helle.

"Midst mores and mosses; woods, and wilds;  
"To lead a lonesome life:  
"Till some yong faire and courtlye knighte,  
"Wolde marrye me to his wife;

"Nor fully to gaine mine owne trewe shape,  
"Such was her devilish skille;  
"Until he wolde yielde to be ruled by mee,  
"And let mee have all my wille.

"She witchd my brother to a carlish boore,  
"And made him stiffe and stronge:  
"And built him a bowre on magicke grounde,  
"To live by rapine and wronge.

"But now the spelle is broken throughe,  
"And wronge is turnde to righte;  
"Henceforth I shall be a faire ladye,  
"And hee be a gentle knighte,"—

CHAPTER 6 — GAWAIN

...

The last poem of this group is _The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell_, originally 925 lines in length. `[A leaf is wanting in the unique MS.]` It is in the South Midland dialect of about 1450. As in so many of these poems it opens with a hunting expedition by Arthur. He parts company with the others to pursue a giant hart, and meets a knight named Sir Gromersomer Joure, who claims that his lands have been wrongfully given to Sir Gawain, and says that he will kill Arthur unless he finds out within a year what women most desire. Arthur has to promise to return, and sets about finding the required answer. He is given enough different replies to fill a large volume; but on the day before his appointment with Gromersomer Joure he meets a hideous hag who tells him that she alone knows the correct one, which she will give him on condition that she may wed Gawain. The King says that he will ask Gawain, who agrees without hesitation. The hag, by name Dame Ragnell, then informs Arthur that women most desire ‘to have the sovereignty'. She will only hold him to the bargain if this is the right answer. Having tried all the other replies, Arthur finally gives Gromersomer Joure that of the hag, which is indeed correct. Gawain has to wed her, to the sorrow of the court, even though he seems cheerful enough. At the wedding feast Ragnell disgusts everyone by eating as much as six men. They retire to bed, and Ragnell demands a kiss from her husband. It is given and she turns into a beautiful maiden, who says that she may be like this either by day or night, according to his choice. Gawain, in accordance with the answer she had given Arthur earlier, puts the matter in her hands, and as a result is told that she will always retain her new form.

This story, of the loathly bride who must win a handsome husband in order to be freed from a spell, is one of the commonest of folk-tales. An Irish version occurs in the twelfth-century Book of Ballynote; the present version may have been Scandinavian in origin, or have been influenced by Scandinavian tales, especially in the detail of the bride's grotesque appetite.

Other English tellings of it are to be found in Gower's Confessio Amantis, and in The Wife of Bath's Tale. The Chaucerian version is probably the best-known of the three, but has the least connections with Arthur. The introduction would appear to show that Chaucer knew the story on which The Gest of Sir Gawain was based; for the main story, he used, with free adaptations, an earlier version of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_. It is the rape of Brandelis's sister which is the central incident of The Gest of Sir Gawain that causes the question: ‘What do women most desire?' Gawain is fittingly punished by having to marry the hideous hag who provides the answer. The feast, obviously in Chaucer's original, is omitted, with the remark that there was no feasting on such a sad occasion. And the final choice is very different: Gawain's bride can either remain hideous and be faithful to her husband, or he can have her beautiful and take his chance. By giving her the choice, he gets her both beautiful and faithful.

Both this free version, and the rather closer one of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_ come from a common original in which Gawain was hero, since Chaucer is unlikely to have added an Arthurian background, and yet, because of the discrepancy in dates, cannot have used the present version of The Wedding. Malory must have known either this or its predecessor, for he mentions Sir Gromersomer Joure. `[Identical with Sir Grummor Grummorson.]`

There is little remarkable in the poem's style, which is very much inferior to _The Wife of Bath's Tale_, although less crude and grotesque than the other works of the ‘primitive' group. Had the Chaucerian version stronger associations with Arthurian literature, it would rank as second only to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. As it is, it hardly falls within our scope, having no more than a name or two and half a dozen lines of introduction to identify it with Arthur and his court.

> Arthur returns to Carlisle and tells Gawain about Sir Gromer's challenge. At Gawain's suggestion, the pair separates and rides through the country, collecting answers in a book. With a month to go, Arthur returns to Ingleswood and meets a monstrously ugly woman, Dame Ragnell. She promises to give Arthur the correct answer, on the condition that he marries her to Sir Gawain. Arthur reluctantly consults Gawain, who agrees because of his love for the king. Arthur returns to the forest once more, where Ragnell tells him that all women want ‘sovereignty'.
>
> When the year is up, Arthur returns to Sir Gromer and gives him his answer. The knight curses Ragnell, his sister, for helping the king, but has to admit that he is right. Ragnell returns to Carlisle with Arthur and insists on a lavish marriage in front of the whole court. Everyone marvels at her ugliness as she devours the splendid wedding banquet. [The couple retire] and Ragnell rebukes Gawain for his lack of sexual desire. He turns to find his wife transformed into a beautiful woman. She offers him a choice: she can be beautiful either at night or during the day. Gawain cannot decide, and tells his wife to make the decision. Delighted, she informs him that he has broken an enchantment placed on her by her stepmother: now that the best knight in England has given her sovereignty, she can be beautiful all the time. The couple go to bed.
>
> When Arthur checks on Gawain the next day, the knight shows him his beautiful wife. The king rejoices, and tells the court about Sir Gromer. Ragnell promises to obey Gawain in all things, and asks Arthur to be good to her brother; everyone agrees that she is the fairest lady at the court. She and Gawain have a son, Gyngolyn, and live in perfect harmony for five years until she dies. The poem concludes with a prayer that its author be released from prison.

> King Arthur spends Christmas at Carlisle with Guinevere and his barons. [While hunting near the Tarn Wathelane, he is accosted by a ferocious baron] who agrees to release him if he returns in a year's time with an answer to the question ‘what do women most desire?' Arthur returns to Carlisle and confides in Gawain, describing the strength and ferocity of the unknown knight. [Arthur and Gawain search for an answer to the question, collecting a sheaf of answers without success]. On the appointed day, Arthur sets out for the Tarn. On his way he meets a hideous crone, dressed in scarlet. She rebukes him for his discourteous greeting, but offers to help him. He eagerly agrees, offering her Gawain in marriage. [She gives him an answer] and he continues on his way. The baron rejects Arthur's sheaf of answers, claiming the king as his captive, until Arthur gives him the crone's reply: ‘a woman desires to have her will'. Vowing to be revenged against the crone, his sister, he admits that Arthur is right and releases him.
>
> [Arthur returns to court and gathers his knights] They all ride into the forest until they come to the crone. Kay scorns her ugliness, but Gawain cryptically remarks that one of them must marry her. Kay and the other knights refuse, [but Gawain agrees and they all return to court. After the wedding, Gawain and his bride retire to his chamber. She transforms into a beautiful young maiden] and offers him a choice: she can be beautiful during the day or during the night. When he chooses night, she reprimands him, reminding him of their public humiliation. He replies that he was simply testing her, and grants her ‘her will'. Delighted, she promises to be beautiful all the time, informing him that she and her brother were bewitched by their wicked stepmother. [They consummate the marriage, and when Kay comes to check on them in the morning, Gawain relates his wife's story]. Kay kisses the maiden, praising her beauty, and they all go to Arthur. The whole court welcomes them and they celebrate.

The Wife of Bath

A merry Wife of Bath comes next in place,  
But somewhat deaf, with an Autumnal Face.  
By Trade a Clothumaker, who ſcorn'd to grant,  
Her Work outdone at *Ipres*, or at *Gaunt*.  
No Matron could with greater Zeal incline,  
To pay her Offering at the *Martyr's Shrine*.  
She neither patient, nor devout could be,  
If any rival'd her in Charity.  
In her own Pariſh ſhe wou'd take the Wall,  
Before the proudeſt Matron of em all:  
Upon a *Sunday* ever trimly dreſt,  
She flaunted forth, the Envy of the reſt,  
Large were her Kerchiffs, yet more gorgeous made  
With her own Work, and full three Pounds they weigh'd.  
Scarlet her Hoſe, her gloſſy Shoes were new;  
Bold was her Face, and ruddy was its Hue.  
Not one of her five Husbands could be foundd,  
She laid 'em ſafely up in holy Ground,  
With theſe ſhe made a ſhift to paſs her Youth;  
Such was this good Wife's Conſtancy and Truth.  
She travell'd far, paſsd many a rapid Stream;  
Thrice ſaw the Reliques of *Jeruſalem*.  
*Rome* and the *Catacombs*, ſhe knew full well;  
Strange things of *Cologne* and its Kings cou'd tell:  
*Spain* ſhe had travell'd o'er from End to End,  
And good St. *James* was very much her Friend.  
Of various Haps and Perils by the Way,  
Much had ſhe known, and yet much more wou'd ſay.  
Upon an ambling Pad at caſe ſhe ſat,  
Gingling the Bitt, and ſlack'd her Pace to chat:  
A ſteeple Hat ſhe wore upon her Head,  
Whoſe ample Brims were like a Buckler ſpread:  
O'er her large Hips a Mantle fairly wrought;  
Before, her Kerchiff to a Point was brought:  
Like a rank Rider, pointed Spurs ſhe wore;  
Of *Jefts* ſhe had an unexhauſted Store.  
Her Talk did notably *Love's Art* advance,  
For ſhe had practis'd long that *Old, New Dance*.

PROLOGUE TO THE WIFE OF BATH'S TALE

By the Same Hand `[Mr. Pope]`

Behold `[The Wife of Bath speaks]` the Woes of Matrimonial Life,  
And hear with Rev'rence an experienc'd Wife!  
To dear—bought Wiſdom give the Credit due,  
And think, for once, a Woman tells you true.  
In all theſe Trials I have borne a Part.  
I was myſelf the Scourge that caus d the Smart:  
For, ſince Fifteen, in Triumph have I led  
Five captive Husbands from the Church to bed.

*Chriſt* ſaw a Wedding once, the Scripture ſays,  
And ſaw but one, tis thought, in all his Days:  
Whence ſome infer, whole Conſcience is too nice,  
No pious *Chriſtian* ought to marry twice.  
But let them read, and ſolve me, if they can,  
The Words addreſe'd to the *Samaritan*.  
Five times in lawful Wedlock ſhe was join'd;  
And ſure the certain Stint was ne'er defin'd.

*Increaſe and Multiply*, was Heav'n's Command,  
And that's a Text I clearly underſtand.  
This too, *Let Men their Sires and Mothers leave*,  
*And to their dearer Wives for ever cleave.*  
More Wives than one by *Solomon* were try'd,  
Or else the Wiſeſt of Mankind's bely'd  
I've had myſelf full many a merry, Fit;  
And truſt in Heav'n I may have many yet.  
For when my tranſitory Spouſe, unkind,  
Shall die and leave his Woeful Wife behind,  
I'll take the next good *Chriftian* I can find.  

*Paul*, knowing one could never ſerve out turn,  
Declar'd, 'twas better far to wed than burn.  
There's Danger in in aſſembling Fire and Tow;  
I grant 'em that; and what it means, you know.  
The ſame Apoſtle too has elſewhere own'd,  
No Precept for Virginity he ſound:  
Tis but a Counſel —  and we Women ſtill  
Take which we like, the Counſel, or our Will.

I envy not their Bliſs, if he or ſhe  
Think fit to live in perfect Chaſtity;  
Pure let them be, and free from Taint of Vice;  
I, for a few ſlight Spots, am not ſo nice.  
Heav'n calls us different Ways, on Theſe beſtowe  
One proper Gift, avother grants to Thoſe:  
Not ev'ry Man's oblig'd to ſell his Store,  
And give up all his Subſtance to the Poor;  
Such, as are perfect, may, I cant deny;  
But, by your Leave, Divines, ſo am not I.

Full many a Saint, fince firſt the World begany .  
Liv'd an unſpotted Maid, in ſpite of Man:  
Let ſuch (a God's Name) with fine Wheat be fed,  
And let us honeſt Wives eat Barley-bread.  
For me, I'll keep the Poſt aſſign'd by Heav'n,  
And uſe the copious Talent it has giv'n:  
Let my good Spouſe pay Tribute, do me Right,  
And keep an equal Reck'ning ev'ry Night,  
His proper Body is not his, but mine;  
For ſo ſaid *Paul* and *Paul*'s a ſound Divine.

Know then, of thoſe five Husbands I have had,  
Three were juſt tolerable, two were bad.  
The three were old, but rich and fond beſide,  
And toil'd moſt piteouſly to pleaſe their Bride:  
But fince their Wealth (the beſt they had) was mine,  
The reſt, without much Loſs, I could retign.  
Sure to be lov'd, I took no Pains to pleaſe,  
Yet had more Pleaſure far than they had Eaſe.

Preſents flow'd in apace: with Show'rs of Gold  
They made their Court, like *Jupiter* of old.  
If I but ſmil'd, a ſudden Youth they found,  
And a new Palſy ſeiz'd them when, I frown'd.

Ye ſov'reign Wives! give ear, and underſtand;  
Thus ſhall ye ſpeak. and exerciſe Command.  
For never was it giv'n to mortal Man,  
To lye ſo boldly as a Woman can.  
Forſwear the Fact, tho' ſeen with both his Eyes;  
And call her Maids to witneſs how he lyes.

'Hark, old Sir *Paul*! ( twas thus I us'd to say)  
'Whence is our Neighbour' s Wife ſo rich and gay?  
'Treat'd; careſs'd, where=e'erſhe's pleas'd to roam?  
'I ſit in Tatters, and immar'd at Home.  
'Why to her Houſe doſt thou ſo oft repair?  
'Art thou ſo am'rous? and is ſhe ſo fair?  
'If I but ſee a Couſin, ora a riend,  
'Lord! how you ſwell, and rage like any Fiend!  
'But you reel Home, a drunken beaſtly Bear,  
'Then preach till Midnight in your eaſy Chair,  
'Cry, Wives are falſe, and ev'ry Woman evil,  
'And give up all that's Female to the Devil.

'If poor, (you ſay) ſhe drains her Husband's Purſe;  
'If rich, ſhe keeps her Prieſt, or ſomething worſe ;  
'If highly born, intolerably vain,  
'Vapours and Pride by turn poſſeſs her Brain;  
'Now gayly mad, now ſourly ſplenetick,  
'Freakiſh when well, and fretful when ſhe's fick,  
'If fair, then chaſte ſhe cannot long abide,  
'By preſſing Youth attack'd on every ſide.  
'If foul, her Wealth the luſty Lover lures,  
'Or elfe her Wit ſome Fool-gallant procures;  
'Or elſe ſhe dances with becoming Grace,  
'Or Shape excuſes the Defects of Face.  
There ſwims no Gooſe ſo grey, but, ſoon or late,  
She finds ſome honeſt Gander for her Mate.

'Horſes (thou ſay'ſt) and Aſſes, Men may try,  
'And ring ſuſpected Veſſels e're they buy:  
'But Wives, a random Choice, untry'd they take,  
'They dream in Courtſhip, but in Wedlock wake:  
'Then, nor till then, the Veil's remov'd away,  
'And al the Woman glares in open Day.

'You tell me, to preſerve your Wife's good Grace.  
'Your Eyes muſt always languiſh on my Face;  
'Your Tongue with conſtant Flatt'ries feed my Ear,  
'And tag each Sentence with, My Life! my Dear!  
'If, by ſtrange Chance, a modeſt Bluſh be rais'd,  
'B'e ſure my fine Complexion muſt be prais'd.  
'My Garments always muſt be new and gay,  
'And Fealts ſtill kept upon my Wedding Day.  
'Then muſt my Nurſe be pleas'd, and fav'rite Maid;  
'And endleſs Treats; and endleſs Viſits paid  
'To a long Train of Kindred, Friends, Allies;  
'All this thou ſayeſt, and all thou ſay'ſt are Lyes.

'On *Jenkin* too you caſt a ſquinting Exy:  
'What! can your Prentice raiſe your Jealouſy?  
'Freſh are his ruddy Cheeks, his Forehead fair,  
'And like the burniſh'd Gold his curling Hair.  
'But clear thy wrinkled Brow, and quit thy Sorrow,  
'I'd ſcorn your Prentice, ſhould you die to-morrow.

'Why are thy Cheſts all lock'd? on what Deſign  
'Are not thy worldly Goods and Treaſure mine?  
'Sir, I'm not Fool; nor ſhall you, by St. *John*,  
'Have Goods and Body to yourſelf alone;  
'One you ſhall quit, in ſpite of both your Eyes—  
'I heed not, I, the Bolts, the Locks, the. Spies.  
'If you had Wit, you d' ſay, Go where you will  
'Dear Spouſe; I credit not the Tales they tell:  
'Take all_ the Freedoms of a married. Life;  
'I know thee for a virtuous, faithful Wife.'

'Lord, when you have enough, what need you care  
'How merrily ſoever others fare?
'Tho? all the Day I give and take Delight,  
'Doubt not, ſufficient will be left at Night,  
' 'Tis but a juſt and rational Deſire,  
'To light a Taper at a Neighbour's Fire.

'There's Danger too, you think, in rich Array,  
'And none can long be modeſt that are gay;  
'The Cat, if you but ſinge her tabby Skin,  
'The Chimney keeps, and fits content within;  
'But once grown fleck, will from her Corner run  
'Sport with her Tail, and wanton in the Sun:  
'She licks her fair round Face, and frisks abroad,  
'To ſhow her Furr, and to be catterwaw'd.

Lo thus, my Friends, I wrought to my Deſires  
Theſe three right-ancient venerable Sires.  
I told em, Thus you ſay, and thus you do—  
And told 'em falſe; but *Jenkin* ſwore twas true.  
I, like a Dog, could bite as well as whine,  
And firſt complain'd, whene'er the Guilt was mine.  
I tax'd them oft with Wenching and Amours,  
When their weak Legs ſcarce dragg'd em out of Doors;  
And ſwore, the Rambles that I took by Night,  
Were all to ſpy what Damſels they bedight.  
That Colour brought me many Hours of Mirth;  
For all this Wit is giv'n us from our Birth,  
Heav'n gave to Woman the peculiar Grace  
To ſpin, to weep, and cully human Race.  
By this nice Conduct, and this prudent Courſe,  
By Murm'ring, Wheedling, Stratagem, and Force,  
1 ſtill prevail'd, and would be in the Right,  
Or Curtain-Lectures made a reſtleſs Night.  
If once my Husband's Arm was o'er my Side,  
What! ſo familiar with your Spouſe? I cry'd:  
I levy'd firſt a Tax upon his Need;  
Then let him ———— 'was a Nicety indeed!  
Let all Mankind this certain Maxim hold,  
Marry who will, our Sex is to be ſold.  
With empty Hands no Taſſels can you lure;  
But fulſome Love for Gain we can-endure;  
For Gold we love the Impotent and Old,  
And heave, and pant, and kifs, and cling for Gold,  
Yet with Embraces, Curſes oft I mixt;  
Then kiſs'd again, and chid and rail'd betwixt.  
Well, I may make my Will in Peace, and die;  
For not one Word in Man's Arrears am I.  
To drop a dear Diſpute I was unable,  
Ev'n tho' the Pope himſelf had ſat at Table.  
But when my Point was gain'd, then thus I ſpoke:  
'*Billy*, my Dear, how ſheepiſhly you look!  
'Approach, my Spouſe, and let me kiſs thy Cheek;  
'Thou ſhould'ſt be always thus, refign'd and meek!  
'Of *Job*'s great Patience ſince fo oft' you preach,  
'Well ſhould you practiſe, who ſo well can teach.  
' 'Tis difficult to do, I muſt allow;  
'But I, my Deareſt, will inſtruct you how,  
'Great is the Bleſſing of a prudent Wite,  
'Who puts a Period to domeſtic Strife.  
'One of us two muſt rule, and one obey;  
'And fince in Man right Reaſon bears the Sway,  
'Let that frail Thing, weak Woman, have her Way.  
'The Wives of all my Family have rul'd  
'Their tender Husbands, and their Paſſions cool'd.  
'Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to ſigh and groan;  
'What! would you have me to yourſelf alone?  
'Why, take me, Love! take all and ev'ry Part!  
'Here's your Revenge! you love it at your Heart.  
'Would I vouchſafe to ſell what Nature gave,  
'You little think what Cuſtom I could have.  
'But fee! I'm all your own — nay, hold — for ſhame!  
'What means my dear — indeed — you are to blame.'

Thus with my firſt three Lords I paſs'd my Life,  
A very Woman, and a very Wife.  
What Sums from theſe old Spouſes I could raiſe,  
Procur'd young Husbands in my riper Days.  
Tho' paſt my Bloom, not yet decay'd was I,  
Wanton and wild, and chatter'd like a Pye:  
In Country-Dances ſtill T'bore the Bell,  
And ſung as ſweet as Evening-*Philomel*.  
To clear my Quall-Pipe, and refreſh my Soul,  
Full oft I drain'd the ſpicy Nut-brown Bowl;  
Rich luſcious Wines, that youthful Blood improve,  
And warm the ſwelling Veins to Feats of Love:  
For 'tis as ſure, as Cold engenders Hail,  
A liqu'riſh Mouth muſt have a lech'rous Tail:  
Wine lets no Lover unrewarded go,  
As all true Gameſters by Experience know.

But oh, good Gods! whene'er a Thought I caſt  
On all the Joys of Youth and Beauty paſt,  
To find in Pleaſures I have had my Part,  
Still warms me to the bottom of my Heart.  
This wicked World was once my dear Delight;  
Now all my Conqueſts, all my Charms, good night!  
The Flour conſum'd, the beſt that now I can  
Is ev'n to make my Market of the Bran.

My fourth dear Spouſe was not exceeding true:  
He kept, twas thought, a private Miſs, or two:  
But all that Score I paid — as how? you'll ſay;  
Not with my Body, in a filthy Way:  
But I fo dreſs d, and danc'd, and drank, and din'd:  
And view'd a Friend, with Eye ſo very kind,  
As ſtung his Heart, and made his Marrow fry  
With burning Rage, and frantick Jealouſy.  
His Soul, I hope, enjoys eternal Glory;  
For here on Earth I washis Purgatory.  
Oft', when his Shoe the moſt ſeverely wrung,  
He put on careleſs: Airs, and fat and ſung.  
How ſore I gall'd him only Heav'n could know,  
And he that felt, and I that caus'd the Woe.  
He dy'd, when laſt from Pilgrimage I came,  
With other Goflips, from *Jeruſalem*;  
And now lies buried underneath a Rood,  
Fair to be ſeen, and rear'd of honeſt Wood.  
A Tomb, indeed, with fewer Sculptures grac'd,  
Than that *Mauſolus*' pious Widow plac'd;  
Or where inſhrind the great *Darius* lay;  
But Coſt on Graves is merely thrown away.  
The Pit fill'd up, with Turf we cover'd o'er;  
So, bleſs the good Man's Soul; I ſay no more.

Woe was the Knight at this ſevere Cemmand ! 
But well he knew 'twas bootleſs to withſtand : 
T he Terms accepted, as the Fair ordain, 

He put in Bail for his Return again ; 

And promis'd Anſwer at the Day aſſign'd, 

The beſt, with Heav'n's Aſſiſtance, he could find, 
His Leave thus taken, on his Way he went 
With heavy Heart, and full of Piſcontent, 
Miſdoubting much, ard fearful of th' Event. 
*T'wes hard the Truth of ſuch a Point to find, 
As was not yet agreed among the Kind. 

Thus on he went ; {till anxious more and more, 
Ask'd all he met, and knock'd at ev'ry Door; 
Enquir'd of Men; but made his chief Requeſt 
To learn from Women what they low 'd the beſt. 
They anſwer'd each according to her Mind, 

To pleaſe herſelf, not all the Female Kind. 

One was for Wealth, another was for Place: 
Crones, old and ugly, wiſh'd a better Face, 
The Widow's Wiſh was, oftentimes to wed 
The wanton Maids were all for Sport a-Bed. 


Some ſaid, the Sex were pleas'd with handſome Lies, 


And ſome groſs Flattry lov'd without Diſguiſe : 
Truth is, ſays one, he ſeldom fails to win, 
Who flatters well; for that's our darling Sin. 
But long Attendance, ald a duteous Mind, 
Will work ev'n with the Wiſeſt of our Kind. 
One thought the Sexes prime Felicity 

Was from the Bonds of Wedlock to be free : 


; 


Their

Their Pleaſures, Hours, and Actions all their on, 
And uncontrolbd to give Account to none. 

Some wiſh a Husband-Fool; but ſuch are curſt, 

For Fools perverſe, of Husbands are the worlt : 

All Women would be counted Chaſte and Wiſe ; | 
Nor ſhould our Spouſes ſee, but with our Eyes: 

For Fools will prate; and tho' they want the Wit 
Io find cloſe Faults, yet open Blots will hit: 
Tho? better for their Eaſe to hold their Tongue, 
For Womankind was never in the Wrong. 

So Noiſe enſues, and Quarrels laſt for Life; 

The Wife abhors the Fool, the Fool the Wife. 
And ſome Men ſay, that great Delight have we 
To be for Truth extoll'd, and Secrecy 3 ; 

And conſtant in one Purpoſe ſtill to dwell, 

And not our Husband's Counſels to reveal. 

But that's a Fable; for our Sex is frail, 

Inventing rather than not tell a Tale. 

Like leaky Sieves, no Secrets we can hold: 

Witneſs the famous Tale that Ovid told. 1 
Midas the King, as in his Book appears, 

By Phabus was endow'd with Aſſes Ears, 

Which under his long Locks he well conceal'd, 

(As Monarchs Vices muſt not be reveal'd) 

For fear the People have *em in the Wind, 

Who long ago were neither Dumb nor Blind; 

Nor apt to think from Heav'n their Title ſprings, 

Since Fove and Mari left of begetting Kings:

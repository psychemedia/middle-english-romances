SIR ISUMBRAS.

The following romance is abridged from the MS. copy in the library of Caius College A 9, collated with the printed copy in Mr Garrick's plays. It consists of 130 six-lined stanzas.

There was once a knight, who from his earliest infancy appeared to be the peculiar favourite of fortune. His birth was noble ; his person equally remarkable for strength and beauty ; his possessions so extensive as to furnish the amusements of hawking and hunting in the highest perfection. Though he had found no opportunity of signalizing his courage in war, he had borne away the prize at numberless tournaments ; his courtesy was the theme of general praise, his hall was the seat of unceasing plenty ; it was crowded with minstrels, whom he entertained with princely liberality, and the possession of a beautiful wife and three lovely children completed the sum of earthly happiness.

Sir Isumbras had many virtues ; but he had one vice. In the pride of his heart he forgot the Giver of all good things, and considered the blessings so abundantly showered upon him, as the proper and just reward of his distinguished merit. Instances of this overweening presumption might perhaps be found in all ages among the possessors of wealth and power ; but few sinners have the good fortune to be recalled, like Sir Isumbras, by a severe but salutary punishment, to the pious sentiments of Christian humility.

It was usual with knights to amuse themselves with hawking or hunting whenever they were not occupied by more serious business ; and as business seldom intervened, they thus amused themselves every day in the year. One morning, being mounted on his favourite steed, surrounded by his dogs, and with a hawk on his fist. Sir Isumbras cast his eyes on the sky, and discovered an angel, who, hovering over him, reproached him with his pride, and announced the punishment of instant and complete degradation.

The terrified culprit immediately fell on his knees ; acknowledged the justice of his sentence ; returned thanks to Heaven for deigning to visit him with adversity while the possession of youth and health enabled him to endure it ; and, filled with contrition, prepared to return from the forest. But scarcely had the angel disappeared when his good steed suddenly fell dead under him ; the hawk dropped from his fist ; his hounds wasted and expired ; and being thus left alone he hastened on foot towards his palace, filled with melancholy forebodings, but impatient to learn the whole extent of his misfortune.

He was shortly met by a part of his household, who, with many tears, informed him that his horses and oxen had been suddenly struck dead with lightning, and that his capons were all stung to death with adders. He received the tidings with humble resignation, commanded his servants to abstain from murmurs against Providence, and passed on. He was next met by a page, who related that his castle was burned to the ground ; that many of his servants had lost their lives ; and that his wife and children had with great difliculty escaped from the flames. Sir Isumbras, rejoiced that Heaven had yet spared those who were most dear to him, bestowed upon the astonished page his purse of gold as a reward for the intelligence.

A doleful sight then gan he see ;  
His wife and his children three  
Out of the fire were fled :  
There they sat, under a thorn,  
Bare and naked as they were born,  
Brought out of their bed.  
A wofui man then was he.  
When lie saw them all naked be.
The lady said, all so alive, "  
For nothing, sir, be ye adrad."  
He did off his surcote of *pallade*, `[Palata, Lat. Paletot, O. Fr. sometimes signifying a parlicular stuff, and sometimes a particular dress. See Du Cange.]`  
And with it clad his wife.  
His scarlet mantle then shore he ;  
Therein he closed his children three  
That naked before him stood.

He then proposed to his wife, that, as an expiation of their sins, they should instantly undertake a pilgrimage to Jerusalem ; and, cutting with his knife a sign of the cross on his naked shoulder, set off with the four companions of his misery, resolved to beg his bread till he shoukl arrive at the holy sepulchre.

After passing through " seven lands," supported by the scanty alms of the charitable, they arrived at length at a forest where they wandered during three days without meeting a single habitation. Their food was reduced to the few berries which they were able to collect ; and the children, unaccustomed to such hard fare, began to sink under the accumulated difficulties of their journey. In this situation they were stopped by a wide and rapid though shallow river. Sir Isumbras, taking his eldest son in his arms, carried him over to the opposite bank, and, placing him under a bush of broom, directed him to dry his tears, and amuse himself by playing with the blossoms till his return with his brother. But scarcely had he left the place when a lion, starting from a neighbouring thicket, seized the child, and bore him away into the recesses of the forest. The second son became, in like manner, the prey of an enormous leopard ; and the disconsolate mother, when carried over with her infant to the fatal spot, was with difficulty persuaded to survive the loss of her two elder children. Sir Isumbras, though he could not repress the tears extorted by this cruel calamity, exerted himself to console his wife, and, humbly confessing his sins, contented himself with prayng that his present misery might be accepted by Heaven as a partial expiation.

Through forest they went days three,  
Till they came to the Greekish sea ;  
They grette, and were full wo !  
As they stood upon the land,  
They saw a fleet come sailand,
Three hundred ships and mo.  
With top-castels set on-loft,  
Richly then were they wrought,  
With joy and mickle pride :  
A heathen king was therein,  
That Christendom came to win ;
His power was full wide.

It was now seven days since the pilgrims had tasted bread or meat ; the soudan's galley, therefore, was no sooner moored to the beach than they hastened on board to beg for food. The soudan, under the apprehension that they were spies, ordered them to be driven back on shore : but his attendants observed to him that these could not be common beggars ; that the robust limbs and tall stature of the husband proved him to be a knight in disguise ; and that the delicate complexion of the wife, who was " bright as blossom on tree," formed a striking contrast to the ragged apparel by which she was very imperfectly covered. They were now brought into the royal presence ; and the soudan, addressing Sir Isumbras, immediately offered him as much treasure as he should require, on condition that he should renounce Christianity, and consent to fight under the Saracen banners. The answer was a respectful but peremptory refusal, concluded by an earnest petition for a little food ; but the soudan, having by this time turned his eyes from Sir Isumbras to the beautiful companion of his pilgrimage, paid no attention to this request ;

The soudan beheld that lady there,  
Him thought an angel that she were,  
Comen a-down from heaven :  
" Man ! I will give thee gold and fee,  
<* An thou that woman will sellen me,  
" More than thou can *neven*. `[Name.]`  
"I will thee given an hundred pound  
" Of pennies that ben whole and round,  
" And rich robes seven :  
" She shall be queen of my land ;  
" And all men bow unto her hand ;  
" And none withstand her *Steven*." `[Voice.]`  
Sir Isumbras said, " Nay !  
" My wife I will nought seli away,  
" Though ye me for her sloo !  
" I wedded her in Godis lay,  
"To hold her to mine ending day,  
" Both for weal and wo."

It evidently would require no small share of casuistry to construe this declaration into an acceptance of the bargain ; but the Saracens, having heard the offer of their sovereign, deliberately counted out the stipulated sum on the mantle of Sir Isumbras ; took possession of the lady ; carried the knight with his infant son on shore ; beat him till he was scarcely able to move ; and then returned for further orders.

During this operation the soudan, with his own hand, placed the regal crown on the head of his intended bride : but recollecting that the original object of his voyage to Europe was to conquer it, which might possibly occasion a loss of some time, he delayed his intended nuptials ; and ordered a fast-sailing vessel to convey her to his dominions; providing her at the same time with a charter addressed to his subjects, in which he enjoined them to obey her, from the moment of her landing, as their legitimate sovereign.

The lady, emboldened by these tokens of deference on the part of her new lord, now fell on her knees, and entreated his permission to pass a few moments in private with her former husband ; and the request was instantly granted by the complaisant Saracen. Sir Isumbras, still smarting from his bruises, was conducted with great respect and ceremony to his wife, who, embracing him with tears, earnestly conjured him to seek her out as soon as possible in her new dominions, to murder his infidel rival, and to take possession of a throne which was probably reserved to him by Heaven as an indemnification for his past losses. She then supplied him with provisions for a fortnight ; kissed him and her infant son ; swooned three times ; and set sail for Africa.

Sir Isumbras, who had been set on shore quite confounded by this quick succession of strange adventures, followed the vessel with his eyes till it vanished from his sight, and then, taking his son by the hand, led him up to some rocky woodlands in the neighbourhood. Here they sat down under a tree, and after a short repast, which was moistened with their tears, resumed their journey. But they were again bewildered in the forest ; and, after gaining the summit of the mountain without being able to descry a single habitation, lay down on the bare ground, and resigned themselves to sleep.

The next morninor Sir Isumbras found that his misfortunes were not yet terminated. He had carried his stock of provisions, together with his gold, the fatal present of the soudan, enveloped in the remnant of his scarlet mantle ; and scarcely had the sun darted his first rays on the earth, when an eagle, attracted by the red cloth, darted down upon the treasure and bore it off in his talons. Sir Isumbras, waking at the moment, perceived the theft, and for some time hastily pursued the flight of the bird, who, he expected, would speedily drop the heavy and useless burthen : but he was disappointed ; for the eagle, constantly towering as he approached the sea, at length directed his flight towards the opposite shores of Africa. Sir Isumbras slowly returned to his child, whom he had no longer the means of feeding ; but the wretched father only arrived in time to behold the boy snatched from him by a unicorn.

The knight was now quite disheartened. But his last calamity was so evidently miraculous, that even the grief of the father was nearly absorbed in the contrition of the sinner. He fell on his knees, and, uttering a most fervent prayer to Jesus and the Virgin, proceeded on his journey.

His attention was soon attracted by the sound of a smith's bellows : he quickly repaired to the forge, and requested the charitable donation of a little food ; but was told by the labourers that he seemed well able to work as they did, and that they had nothing to throw away in charity.

Then answered the knight again,  
" For meat would I *swink* `[Labour.]` fain !"  
Fast he bare and *drow* ; `[Drew.]`  
They given him meat and drink anon.  
And taughten him to bear stone :  
Then had he shame enow.

This novitiate lasted a twelvemonth ; and seven years expired before he had fully attained all the mysteries of his new profession. He employed his few leisure hours in fabricating a complete suit of armour ; every year had brought to his ears an account of the progress of the Saracens ; and he could not help entertaining a hope that his arm, though now so ignobly employed, was destined, at some future day, to revenge the wrongs of the Christians, as well as the injury which he had personally received from the unbelievers.

At length he heard that the Christian army had again taken the field ; that the day was fixed for a great and final effort ; and that a plain at an inconsiderable distance from bis shop was appointed for the scene of action. Sir Isumbras rose before day, buckled on his armour ; and, mounting a horse which had hitherto been employed in carrying coals, proceeded to the field, and took a careful survey of the disposition of both armies. When the trumpets gave the signal for the charge, he dismounted, fell on his knees, and, after a short but fervent prayer to Heaven, again sprang into his saddle, and rode into the thickest ranks of the enemy. His uncouth war-horse and awkward armour had scarcely less effect than his wonderful address and courage in attracting the attention of both parties ; and when, after three desperate charges, his sorry steed was slain under him, one of the Christian chiefs made a powerful effort for his rescue, bore him to a neighbouring eminence, and presented to him a more suitable coat of armour, and a horse more worthy of his heroic rider.

"When he was armed on that steed.  
It is seen yet where his horse *yede*, `[Went.]`  
And shall be evermore.  
As sparkle glides offtlie glede, `[Hot iron.]`  
In that stour he made many bleed,  
And wrought hem wonder sore.  
He rode up into the mountain.  
The soudan soon hath he slain,  
And many that with him were.  
All that day lasted the fight ;  
Sir Isumbras, that noble knight,  
Wan the battle there.  
Knights and squires han him sought,  
And before the king him brought;  
Full sore wounded was he.  
They asked what was his name ;  
He said, " Sire, a smith's man ;  
" What will ye do with me ?"  
The Christian king said, than,  
" I trow, never smith's man  
" In war was half so wight."  
" I *bid* `[Pray.]` you, give me meat and drink,  
" And what that I will after think,  
" Till I have *kevered* `[Recovered.]` my might."  
The king a great oath sware,  
As soon as he whole were,  
That he would dub him knight.  
In a nunnery they him leaved,  
To heal the wounds in his heved.  
That he took in that fight.  
The nuns of him were ful fain ;  
For he had the soudan slain.  
And many heathen hounds.  
For his sorrow they gan sore rue ;  
Every day they salved him new.  
And stopped well his wounds.

We may fairly presume, without derogating from the merit of the holy sisters, or from the virtue of their salves and bandages, that the knight's recovery was no less accelerated by the pleasure of having chastized the insolent purchaser of his wife, and the author of his contumelious beating. In a few days his health was restored; and, having provided himself with a " scrip and pike," and the other accoutrements of a Palmer, he took his leave of the nuns, directed his steps once more to the " Greekish Sea," and, embarking on board of a vessel which he found ready to sail, speedily arrived in the port of Acre.

During seven years, which were employed in visiting every part of the Holy Land, the penitent Sir Isumbras led a life of continued labour and mortification ; fed during the day by the precarious contributions of the charitable, and sleeping at night in the open air, without any addition to the scanty covering which his pilgrim's weeds, after seven years' service, were able to afford. At length his patience and contrition were rewarded.

After a day spent in fruitless applications for a little food,

Beside the burgh of Jerusalem  
He set him by a well-stream,  
Sore wcpand for his sin.  
And as he sat, about midnight.  
There came an angel fair and bright.  
And brought him bread and wine ;  
He said, " Palmrr, well thou be ! "  
The King of heaven greetrth well thee;  
" Forgiven is sin thine."

Sir Isumbras accepted with pious gratitude the donation of food, by which his strength was instantly restored, and again set out on his travels : but he was still a widower ; still deprived of his children, and as poor as ever ; nor had his heavenly monitor afforded him any hint for his future guidance. He wandered therefore through the country, without any settled purpose, till he arrived at a " rich burgh," built round a " fair castle," the possessor of which, he was told, was a charitable queen, who daily distributed a florin of gold to every poor man who approached her gates, and even condescended to provide food and lodging within her palace for such as were distinguished by superior misery. Sir Isumbras presented himself with the rest ; and his emaciated form and squalid garments procured him instant admittance.

The rich queen in hail was set ;  
Knights her served, at hand and feet,  
In rich robes of pall :  
In the floor a cloth was laid ;  
" The poor Palmer," the steward said,  
" Shall sit above you all."  
Meat and drink forth they brought ;  
He sat still, and ate right nought,  
But looked about the hall.  
So mickle he saw of game and glee,  
(Swiche mirths he was wont to see)  
The tears he let down fall.

A conduct so unusual attracted the attention of the whole company, and even of the queen, who, orderhig " a chair with a cushion" to be placed near the Palmer, took her seat in it, entered into conversation with him on the subject of his long and painful pilgrimage, and was much edified by the moral lessons which he interspersed in his narrative. But no importunity could induce him to taste food : he was sick at heart, and required the aid of solitary meditation to overcome the painful recollections which continually assailed him. The queen was more and more astonished, but at length left him to his reflections, after declaring that " for her lord's soul, or for his love, if he were still alive," she was determined to retain the holy Palmer in her palace, and to assign him a convenient apartment, together with a " knave" or servant to attend him.

An interval of fifteen years, passed in the laborious occupations of blacksmith and pilgrim, may be supposed to have produced a very considerable alteration in the appearance of Sir Isumbras ; and even his voice, subdued by disease and penance, may have failed to detect the gallant knight under the disguise which he had so long assumed. But that his wife (for such she was) should have been equally altered by the sole operation of time ; that the air and gestures and accents of a person once so dear and so familiar to him, should have awakened no trace of recollection in the mind of a husband, though in the midst of scenes which paintully recalled the memory of his former splendour, is more extraordinary. Be this as it may, the knight and the queen, though lodged under the same roof, and passing much of their time together, continued to bewail the miseries of their protracted widowhood.

Sir Isumbras, however, speedily recovered, in the plentiful court of the rich queen, his health and strength, and with these, the desire of returning to his former exercises. A tournament was proclaimed ; and the lists, which were formed immediately under the windows of the castle, were speedily occupied by a number of Saracen knights, all of whom Sir Isumbras successively overthrew. So dreadful was the stroke of his spear, that many were killed at the first encounter; some escaped with a few broken bones; others were thrown headlong into the castle ditch : but the greater number consulted their safety by a timely flight ; while the queen contemplated with pleasure and astonishment the unparalleled exploits of her favourite Palmer.

Then fell it, upon a day,  
The knight went him for to play,  
As it was ere his kind ;  
A fowl's nest he found on high ;  
A red cloth therein he *seygh* `[Saw.]`  
Wavand in the wind.  
To the nest he gan win ;  
His own mantle he found therein ;  
The gold there gan he find.

The painful recollection awakened by this discovery weighed heavily on the soul of Sir Isumbras. He bore the fatal treasure to his chamber ; concealed it under his bed ; and spent the remainder of the day in tears and lamentations. The images of his lost wife and children now began to haunt him continually ; and his altered demeanour attracted the attention and excited the curiosity of the whole courf, and even of the queen, who could only learn from the Palmer's attendant that his melancholy seemed to originate in the discovery of something found in a bird's nest. With this strange report she was compelled to be satisfied, till Sir Isumbras, with the hope of dissipating his grief, began to resume his usual exercises in the field : but no sooner had he quitted his chamber than the " squires" by her command broke open the door, discovered the treasure, and hastened with it to the royal apartment.

The sight of the gold and of the scarlet mantle immediately explained to the queen the whoJe mystery of the Palmer's behaviour. She burst into tears ; kissed with fervent devotion the memorial of her lost husband ; fell into a swoon ; and, on her recovery, told the whole story to her attendants, and enjoined them to go in quest of the Palmer, and to bring him immediately before her. A short explanation removed her few remaining doubts ; she threw herself into the arms of her husband ; and the re-union of this long-separated couple was immediately followed by the coronation of Sir Isumbras, and by a long series of festivity.

The Saracen subjects of this Christian sovereign continued, with unshaken loyalty, to partake of the plenteous entertainments provided for all ranks of people on this solemn occasion : but no sooner had the pious Isumbras signified to them the necessity of their immediate conversion, than his whole " parliament" adopted the resolution of deposiug and committing to the flames their newly-acquired sovereign, as soon as they should have obtained the concurrence of the neighbouring princes. Two of these readily joined their forces for the accomplishment of this salutary purpose, and, invading the territories of Sir Isumbras with an army of thirty thousand men, sent him, according to usual custom, a solemn defiance.

Sir Isumbras boldly answered the defiance; issued the necessary orders ; called for his arms; sprang upon his horse ; and prepared to march out against the enemy ; when he discovered that his subjects had, to a man, abandoned him, and that he must encounter singly the whole host of the invaders.

Sir Isumbras was bold and keen,  
And took his leave at the queen.  
And sighed wonder sore :  
He said, " Madam, have good day !  
" Sekerly, as I you say.  
" For now and evennore !"  
" Help me, sir, that I were dight  
" In arms, as it were a knight ;  
" I will with you fare :  
" Gif God would us grace send  
" That we may together end,  
" Then done were all my care."  
Soon was the lady dight  
In arms, as it were a knight ;  
He gave her spear and shield :  
Again thirty thousand Saracens, and mo,  
There came no mo but they two,  
When they met in field.

Never, probably, did a contest take place between such disproportioned forces. Sir Isumbras was rather encumbered than assisted by the presence of his beautiful but feeble helpmate; and the faithful couple were on the point of being crushed by the charge of the enemy, when three unknown knights suddenly made their appearance, and as suddenly turned the fortune of the day. The first of these was mounted on a lion ; the second on a leopard ; and the third on a unicorn. The Saracen cavalry, at the first sight of these unexpected antagonists, dispersed in all directions. But flight and resistance were equally hopeless: three-and-twenty thousand unbelievers were soon laid lifeless on the plain by the talons of the lion and leopard, by the resistless horn of the unicorn, or by the sword of their young and intrepid riders ; and the small remnant of the Saracen army who escaped from the general carnage quickly spread through every corner of the Mahometan empire, the news of this signal and truly miraculous victory.

Sir Isumbras, who does not seem to have possessed the talent of unravelling mysteries, had never suspected that his three miraculous auxiliaries were his own children, whom Providence had sent to his assistance at the moment of his greatest distress ; but he was not the less thankful when informed of the happy termination of all his calamities. The royal family were received in the city with every demonstration of joy by his penitent subjects, whose loyalty had been completely revived by the recent miracle. Magnificent entertainments were provided; after which Sir Isumbras, having easily over-run the territories of his two Pagan neighbours who had been slain in the last battle, proceeded to conquer a third kingdom for his younger son ; and the four monarchs, uniting their efforts for the propagation of the true faith, enjoyed, "*as the romance tells us*" the happiness of witnessing the baptism of all the inhabitants of their respective dominions.

They lived and died in good intent ;  
Unto heaven their souls went  
When that they dead were.  
Jesu Christ, heaven's king,  
Give us, aye, his blessing,  
And shield us from care !

Sir Isumbras

IS peculiarly an English Romance — at least we know of no version in a foreign tongue, and, indeed, those in English are very scarce. Three MSS. are known to exist, all of the i$th century, one at Lincoln, in the Thornton Collection ; another in the library of Caius College, Cambridge ; and a third is in the British Museum (Cotton, Caligula, A. ii.). These have been published — the first *in extenso* — but the language is very archaic, so that I have preferred taking the first printed copy I could find, and that is one printed by William Copland. Black letter, no date, but in the British Museum Catalogue it is approximately given as 1550. This edition fulfilled most of the conditions I required. Any one with a very slight knowledge of Old English could read it easily, and, although it varies in its language from the MSS., it is in complete accord with them as to the story.

The frontispiece is evidently much older than the printing, as the wood-block of the knight is both wormeaten and broken. It served its purpose, however, as it had already done duty as frontispiece for Syr Bevys of Hampton, published by the same printer.

Of all the nobles of his time, Sir Isumbras seems tohave been the most favoured. Of specially comely person, great strength, and prowess in arms, wealthy, and yet liberal of his wealth, with a beautiful wife and three lovely children — a happier existence could hardly be imagined ; and so the old chronicler seems to have, thought when he wrote.

Ye shall well heare of a knight  
That was in warre full wyght, `[Active]`
And doughtye `[Brave.]` of his dede.  
Hys name was syr Isenbras,  
Man nobler than he was,  
Lyved none with breade.  
He was lyvely, large and longe,  
With shoulders broade, and armes stronge  
That myghtie was to se.  
He was a hardy man and hye,  
All men hym loved that hym se,  
For a gentyll knight was he.  
Harpers loved him in hall,  
With other minstrels all,  
For he gave them golde and fee.  
He was as curtoise as men might thinke,  
Lyberall of meate and drynke  
In the worlde was none so fre.  
He hade a ladye full of beautye  
And also full of charitie  
As any lady might be.  
Betwene them thay had chyldren thre,  
Fayrer forms myght no man se  
Under the cope of heaven.

This reads somewhat like the perfection of human bliss, and so it might have been, had not Sir Isumbras lacked some spiritual essentials, which, in all probability, was owing to his worldly prosperity and happiness. He was puffed up with pride, and never thought of the Giver of all things, who had so bounteously bestowed His favours upon him ; and God thought it necessary, for the knight's soul's sake, and for the salutary lesson to be learned from the example he intended to make of him, to chasten him for his pride and bring him low.

So, after, it befell on a daye  
That this knyght went him to piaye  
Hys forest for to se.  
As he loked up on hye  
He sawe an aungell in the skye  
Which toward hym dyd flye.  
Isenbras, he sayde there,  
Thou hast forgotten what thou were  
For pryde, and golde, and fee.  
Wherfore our lord sayth to thee so  
All thy good[s] thou must forego  
As thou shalt hereafter se.  
The worldes welth shall fro the `[From thee.]` fall,  
Thou shalt lose thy children all,  
And all thy landes free.  
Thy lady goodlyest of all,  
For feare of fyre shall flye thy hall  
This daye or thou her se.
The knyghte fell doune upon his kne  
Underneth an Olyve tre  
And helde up both his handes.  
And then agayne thus sayde he  
Lorde God in trinitie  
Welcome be thy soundes.  
While I am yonge, I maye well go,  
When I am olde, I may not so,  
Though that I fayne woulde.  
Therfore Jesu I pray thee  
In youth send me adversitie,  
And not when I am olde.  
The aungel toke from thence his flight,  
And left alone that carefull knyght ;  
From hym he wente his waye.

Swift was the divine punishment ; for no sooner was the angel gone, than his strong steed dropped down dead from under him, and his hawks and hounds suddenly expired, and in this plight nought was left for him but to take his sad way homeward on foot, whilst the tears streamed down his cheeks. On his way he was met by some of his household, who had but sad news to give him : how that all his cattle had been destroyed by adders, that worms had killed his capons, and that he had no beast left for the plough, they having died from the effects of thunder. He took their news with becoming resignation and bade them pass on. Sad-hearted, he still bent his steps homeward, when he was met by " a lytle lad " who told him the grievous news that all his castle, &c., was burned to the ground, and that many of his people had been killed. In fact the only lives saved were those of his wife and children who had fled for fear of the fire. When he reached the scene of the catastrophe he found it even as it had been reported unto him.

A dolefull sight than gan he se,  
Hys wyfe and his chyldren thre  
Out of the fyre were fled.  
There they sate under a thorne  
Bare and naked as they wer borne,  
Brought out of theyr bed.

He took off his "surcoat of pallade" `[A rich kind of cloth.]` and put it on his wife, cut his scarlet mantle into three pieces in which to wrap his children, and, being fully imbued with the awful punishments with which God had thought good to afflict him, he suggested to his wife that they should at once set out on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and visit Calvary. This resolution they carried into effect at once, but in a very meek, and lowly fashion.

The lorde and the ladye bende `[Bowed to circumstances.]`  
Toke theyr way for to wende  
Upon the same daye.  
Whan that they departe shoulde  
For them wept both yonge and olde,  
Both wyfe, wydow, man and maye. `[Maid.]`  
They bare with them no maner of thynge  
That was worth a farthynge,  
Cattell, golde ne fe. `[Nor property.]`  
But mekely they asked theyr meate  
Where that they myght it gette  
For saynct charytie.

In this humble manner they passed through " seven lands " safely, sometimes subsisting on the alms of the charitable ; at others, only on berries, and the tender shoots of the thorn. At length they came to a river, through which Sir Isumbras waded, with his eldest child in his arms, and, having placed him under a bush of broom, he re-crossed the river to fetch his second born ; but, whilst he was in mid stream, a lion bore away his eldest boy, and a leopard took his next child, who was with his mother.

After the first burst of grief they piously bowed to the will of the Creator, and pursued their journey through a forest, until they came to the sea shore, where they saw a fleet of " thre hundred shyppes and mo," belonging to the Soudan of the Saracens, who was there in person. As they had tasted neither meat nor drink for seven days, they not unnaturally agreed to pay the Soudan a visit, and ask for some provisions. But the Soudan thought they were spies, and ordered them to be beaten and sent away. Their pitiful case, however, was apparent to the bystanders, and caused much commiseration among them.

A knyght kneled before the kynge  
And sayd it is a pytifull thynge  
That poore penaunce to se.  
He semeth a man so gentyll and fre,  
Though he be in necessitie,  
It is ruth `[Compassion should be shown him.]` and pytie.  
His eyen are gray as any glasse ;  
Were he as well fedde as ever he was  
Like a knight shoulde he be.  
Hys wyfe as wyte as whalesbone,  
Though she with weping be overgone,  
She is as white as blosome on tre.

This intercession had weight with the Soudan, and he ordered the wayfarers to be brought before him, which was done, after they had been fed and clothed. He was struck with Sir Isumbras's personal appearance, and offered to dub him a knight if he would go and fight for him, first of all renouncing Christianity and embracing the faith of Mahound. But this was too much for Sir Jsumbras's othodoxy :

I shall never Hethen hounde become,  
Nor warre againste Christendome,  
Therfore to dye thys daye (he was willing).  
Create wayes we have to gone,  
Meat ne drynke have we none,  
Ne penye for to paye.  
Syr, helpe us to our lyves fode, `[Food.]`  
For hys love that dyed on rode, `[Rood, or cross.]`  
And let us walk awaye.

But this was not to be, for the Soudan was struck by the angelic beauty of the lady, and, after his Oriental manner, he wished to purchase her of her husband, offering him "an hundred pounde of fayre Florence rede and rounde, and red robes seven : " besides which, she was to be made the Soudan's queen. Needless to say, Sir Isumbras indignantly refused such a bargain, but the Soudan had *force majeure* on his side, paid the money and garments, and seized the lady. Sir Isumbras threw away the money, and, for his pains, got a terrible beating, from which, as soon as he was recovered, he took his son by the hand and went forth. Seemingly both Sir Isumbras and his wife looked upon these events as manifestations of the Divine will, and accepted them with resignation, for the Soudan immediately crowned the lady as his queen, and she made no resistance thereto, only stipulating to have a few last words with her former husband.

This was granted, and, after an affecting interview, she advised Sir Isumbras to go away, and, for the future, to exert all his energies in endeavouring to conquer and kill the Soudan, and enjoy his kingdom.

Then this ladye meke and mylde  
Kyssed hym, and than her chylde,  
Then sowned `[Swooned.]` she tymes thre.

After which she sailed for Syria, and her husband, accepting the position, took the gold and red robes, and with his little son went on his way. At night, weary and tired, they lay upon the bare earth, but with the morn came an adventure, for an eagle carried off the red robes in which were wrapped both the gold, for which he had sold his wife, and also his provisions. He followed the bird till stopped by the shores of the Grecian Sea, over which the eagle flew, and he returned sadly to his young son, who, however, in the meantime, had been carried off by an unicorn ; and this last blow utterly crushed the knight.

The knyghte afore was often wo,  
But never then he was so,  
He set hym on a stone.  
Lorde, he saye, wo is me,  
For my wyfe and my chyldren thre,  
Now am I left alone.  
The kynge that bare of thorne the croune,  
Wysshe me a waye unto the towne,  
For all amysse have I gone.

Hungry, tired, and heartsore, he proceeded on his way, until he saw the light of a fire, which proceeded from a smith's forge. He begged for bread, but the smiths were utilitarian in their ideas, and refused to give any unless he worked for it. " They sayde, labour, for so do we." Sir Isumbras complied, and worked for them for a twelvemonth in doing arduous and menial work, but after that time he was initiated into the art and mystery of working in iron, and he worked at this trade for seven years, becoming so proficient therein that he was enabled to make himself a suit of armour, and all that belonged to a knight's outfit.

At the end of that time he heard that the Christians had taken the field against the Saracens, and he determined to join them ; so, buckling on his armour, he got the best substitute for a charger that he could, " a croked caple that coles broughte," and started for the fray. Needless to say he fought like a paladin, until the poor "caple" was slain. His prowess had been so prominent, that when this event happened, an Earl gave him a good steed and a fine suit of armour instead of his home-made one. Thus accoutred, he once more mixed in the melee, dealing hard blows all round, and at last he slew the Soudan. Such a feat as this could not fail of recognition by the Christian king, and Sir Isumbras was brought before him, all wounded as he was, and questioned as to who he was.

Syr, quod he, a smythe's man,  
To defend thee in fyghte.

The king promised to make him a knight, and generally to look after his fortune, and, in the meantime, ordered him to a nunnery, where the good sisters might heal him of his wounds. Here he was greatly petted,

Because he had the Sowdan slayne,  
With many a Heathen hounde.

When he got well, he would not wait for honours to be bestowed upon him, but dressed himself like a palmer, and, having taken a grateful farewell of the prioress and the nuns, he again set out on his pilgrimage. He found a ship sailing for Acre, and soon reached that city, from whence he prosecuted his pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. Hard and toilsome was the way, and the food, too, poor and insufficient ; but a blessed change was at hand, and he was about to reap the reward of his sufferings.

Faint and hungry,  
Beside the borowe `[Burgh, or town.]` of Bethlem,  
He set hym by a well streme,  
Tyll the day was dymme.  
As he sat and sore syght  
There came an aungell about mydnight  
And brought hym bread and wyne.  
Isenbras, he sayde, lysten unto mee,  
Our lorde hath pardon graunted to thee,  
Forgeven are synnes thyne.  
Nowe rest the well, syr Isenbras,  
Forgeven is all thy trespas,  
Shortly for to sayne. `[Say.]`  
My Lorde is heaven['s] kynge  
Hath the geven hys blessynge,  
And byddeth the turne agayne.  
The knyght on his knees hym set,  
And Christ of heaven kynge he grete[d],  
Of the tydynges he was fayne. `[Glad.]`

The angel left him, and Sir Isumbras, fortified by the food he had taken, retraced his steps. He wandered about until he heard of a fair castle, wherein dwelt a queen, who was a paragon of all that was good, and

Every day she made a dole  
Of many florences, gold and hole, `[I.e., not clipped, but nice and round, fresh from the mint.]`  
Whoso woulde it fetche.

Sir Isumbras was in that lowly condition when either money or meat would be acceptable, and at once made for that castle. He joined the ranks of the poor, and duly received his golden florin from the queen, who chose fifty of the poorest and feeblest from among them, and Sir Isumbras with them. The queen presided at the feast of these poor folk, and, from some cause unexplained, either from his superior state of emaciation, or from his palmer's garb, denoting a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the steward gave directions that he should sit above all the other company. Food and drink were given him, but he did not partake of them, but sat still, shedding tears. Probably this behaviour called particular attention to him, for the queen ordered a chair and a cushion to be provided for the poor palmer, that he might relate to her the adventures he had met with in the many lands through which he had travelled. He gratified her curiosity with many traveller's tales, but no temptation in the form of rich meats, &c., could induce him to eat. The queen bade him dread nothing, but —

For his soule that was my Lorde  
I will the finde at bed and borde,  
Fayre to cloth and feede.  
At thyne ease thou shalt be,  
With much mirth game and gle,  
Both early and late.  
A clene chamber and a fayre,  
And a man to serve thee  
Within the castle gate —

a position which was gratefully accepted by Sir Isumbras who fell on his knees and thanked the queen ; but this promotion naturally brought with it envy from those less fortunate. At length there was a tournament, and he was horsed " on a fayre stede." His generous diet had brought back his old strength, and he played havoc with the Saracens ; none could stand before him.

Some he caste over the lake,  
Of some both necke and backe he brake,  
They fled from hym for drede.  
The ladye seying that, fast lough, `[Laughed loudly.]`  
And sayde my palmer is strong ynough,  
And worthy for to ryde.

And now a curious adventure befel Sir Isumbras, bordering somewhat on the marvellous : for, as he was walking one day, he espied a heron's nest, wherefrom fluttered a red cloth. Being somewhat amazed at this singular sight he climbed the tree, and in the nest he found his own red robe, of which the eagle had robbed him, still containing the gold which had been given him as the price of his wife, the sight of which well-nigh sent him mad.

When he se the reade golde  
Wherfore hys ladye was solde,  
Then was he woode `[Mad.]` of mynde.  
The golde into the chambre he bare,  
Under his heade he putte it there,  
Then wepynge he went his waye.  
Ever when he the golde gan se,  
Hys songe was well a waye.
Were he never of chere so good  
Whan he in hys chamber yode `[Went.]`  
After he wepte all the daye.

This lachrymose behaviour naturally attracted attention, and was reported to the queen ; and, by way of solving the mystery, four knights broke open the door of Sir Isumbras' chamber, and found the red robes and the gold, which they took to the queen, who, at the sight of these tokens, especially of the gold for which she had been sold into splendid slavery, swooned thrice. When she came to herself —

Often she syghed, and sayde alas,  
This ought a knyght Syr Isenbras  
That my lorde was wont to be.  
Unto the knyghts there she tolde  
How that she for golde was solde,  
Her lorde was beaten there.  
Where ye maye the palmer se  
Byd hym come and speke with me:  
Therto me longeth sore.  
The palmer came into the hall,  
Unto counsell she dyd him call,  
And asked hym right there.  
How that he the golde wan,  
And whether he were a gentleman,  
And in what countre he was borne.  
With carfull harte, `[Heart full of care.]` and rewfull `[Rueful.]` dreare  
He gave the quene this aunswere  
On knees her before.  
The first tale that he her tolde  
Madame therfore my wife was solde  
I do you to understande.  
Thre chyldren have I lore, `[Lost.]`  
My mantel was awaye bore,  
I in a nest it founde.  
Tho `[Then.]` had the lady great solace,  
She fell in sowning, so faynt she was  
When they together met.  
There was myrthe to se them mete  
With clypping `[Embracing.]` and kissing swete  
In armes for to folde.  
Eyther of other was so fayne  
They wolde it no longer layne ; `[They would no longer delay their reunion.]`  
To the knyghtes they it tolde.  
A ryche brydale dyd they byd,  
Both riche and poore thyther yede, `[Went.]`  
Would none themselfe with holde.  
Syr Isenbras was rayed `[Arrayed, apparelled.]` ryght,  
And crowned kyng, that erre `[ Erst, before.]` was knyght,  
With a gaye garlande of golde.

The chronicle does not treat of the happiness of the reunited pair, but it can well be imagined. It was hardly to be expected that his most Christian Majesty King Isumbras would live in friendly accord with the dogs of Mahound, his heathen neighbours ; nor, indeed, does he seem to have gained the affection of his own subjects, for when his neighbours rose against him, all his people, without exception, forsook him, and left him perfectly alone to fight the Saracen hosts.

Sir Isumbras does not seem to have quailed, although he felt he must be going to certain destruction. His parting from his queen is well told.

Syr Isenbras curtoyse and kene `[Earnest, bold.]`  
Toke hys leave of his quene,  
And after syghed full sore.  
He loked on her with eyen graye  
And sayd, Madame, have good daye  
For now and evermore.  
The ladye sayd unto the knight,  
I woulde I were in armure bright  
With you that I myght fare.  
If God woulde the grace sende,  
That we myght together wende,  
Then gone were all my care.  
Sone was the lady dyghte `[Clad.]`  
In armure as she were a knyghte,  
With horse, with speare, and shelde.  
Agaynst thyrty thousand Sarasins, and mo  
Of christen came but they two  
Alone into the feylde.

Strong indeed must have been the faith that impellec the pair to encounter the Saracenic horde. The heather raged furiously around them, but the knight was calm, anc swore by " swete Jesu " that he would not give in whilsi he " may in styrope stande," and his lady, following hi< example, swore by " Mary mylde " that " she woulde do hei myghte." The battle began, and they twain did prodigies of valour, overcoming all who came against them, until the Soudan of the Saracens " was out of his wyt," and promised rewards and lands to any one who would lay Sir Isumbras low.

It was not to be done single-handed, and it was therefore proposed that a combined rush should be made on Sir Isumbras, and thus overwhelm him with sheer force of numbers. This was done, and the knight and his lady were in such sore straits, that but a short time could only elapse before they certainly must be slain, when a miracle came to their aid.

Ryght as they slayne shoulde have be, `[Been.]`  
There came ryding kynges thre  
On beastes that were wylde.  
One on a Leoparde, and one on a Unicorne,  
And one a Lion, one ranne beforne, `[Before.]`  
Theyr eldest sonne to beare.  
The knyghtes fought as they were wode, `[Mad.]`  
And slewe all that before them stode ;  
Great wonder it was to se.  
The Heathen knyghtes slew the `[They.]` there,  
The Sarasyns that counted were  
Thurtye thousand and thre.

It is needless to say that these three champions who arrived so opportunely were the three lost children of Sir Isumbras and his wife. The chronicle does not attempt to account for their sudden appearance other than " The grace of God us hether sent." Sir Isumbras' faithless subjects seem to have returned to their allegiance, and everything went very happily. The three sons each conquered him a " land," and christianized the people, and the Romance concludes.

Than was Kynge Syr Isenbras  
Of more welth than ever he was,  
And come out of his care.
To every sonne he gave a lande,  
And crouned hym kynge with his hande,  
Whyle they together were.  
The eldest sonne was in Surrye `[Syria.]`  
Chosen chyefe of chyvalre,  
As kynge and governoure.  
The seconde sonne, shortly to say,  
In an He called laffaye  
Reygned with great honour.  
The youngest brother was crowned kynge  
Of Calabre without leasynge : `[Lying.]`  
Thus reygned they all thre.  
And when it pleased God of hys myght,  
They all departed in heavens lyght,  
To the whiche brynge us the trinitie,  
Amen, Amen, for charitie.

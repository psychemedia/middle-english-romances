<h1>Sir Orfeo<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-orfeo" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>A mediaeval retelling of the myth of <em>Orpheus and Eurydice</em>, which I’ve used a couple of times to frame the sinking of HMS Eurydice (see ??), recast as a tale of a proud (and not in a good way!) knight who is beset by misfortune and who sets out to recover his wife who is kidnapped into the land of Faerie.</p>
<p>I first came across this in the back of the paperback version of <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, with Pearl and Sir Orfeo</em>, Harper Collins, 2021, translated by J.R.R. Tolkien, ed. C. Tolkien.</p>

<p>Tales of true knights
by Krapp, George Philip, 1872-1934</p>
<p>Publication date 1921</p>
<p>pp165-184</p>
<p>SIR ORFEO</p>
<p>SIR ORFEO was a brave knight and a true, and he dwelt in the land of the Grecians. Of high kin he was, for his father came of the stock of King Pluto, who ruled over the nether world, and his mother was of the race of Juno, the queen of the heavens. Wisely and well Sir Orfeo governed his people, sparing neither pains nor trouble to make them happy. One thing in this world, however, Sir Orfeo was more zealous in than in caring for the welfare of his people, and this one thing was the music the gleemen made in their harping. A welcome was ready for every good harper who found his way to Sir Orfeo’s castle, and there you were always sure of meeting with the best of them. Sir Orfeo himself took great joy in harping, and so earnestly did he busy himself in that art that no one of the great throng of minstrels who came to his castle could boast himself a better harper than its master.</p>
<p>A fair lady named Herodys was the wife of Sir Orfeo, and among all the Grecians none was praised more highly for her gentleness and beauty. Now, it happened once upon a sunny morning in May that the Lady Herodys called her two maidens and went forth in the freshness of the day to walk in her garden. The bitter storms of winter were now past, and everywhere the flowers were springing in the green grass, and every spray and bough of the bushes was covered with bright blossoms. The sun made the air so soft and pleasant, the birds sang so gaily, and the flowers spread abroad such sweetness, that the Lady Herodys and her two maidens sat them down under a young tree to take their joy in the mild season. For a while they praised the beauties of this spring morning, and then talked of this and that, until a heaviness weighed down the eyelids of the Lady Herodys and she leaned on her elbow on the soft grass and fell into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Silently the two maidens stole away to another part of the garden, and there they amused themselves for some time in merry talk and laughter. When they thought their lady must have roused from her slumber, they came back to the young tree, but were surprised to find her lying there and still soundly sleeping. They knew not what to do, for they could not be so bold as to wake their mistress, yet they thought it strange her sleep should be so lasting. Quietly they sat them down beside their lady and patiently waited for her eyes to open. But the sun mounted higher and higher, and passed over their heads at the noontide, and already was sinking to the western sky in the dusk of the evening, before the Lady Herodys stirred and gave signs of return to the land of the living. Suddenly her eyes flew open, and she started up in fear and trembling. She wrung her hands in grief, and cried aloud in pain and sorrow. More like one who had lost her reason she bore herself than like the gentle Herodys. Hastening to her side, the two maidens sought to comfort their lady, but Herodys paid no heed to them and seemed not to hear the words they spake to her. In terror and dismay at what had happened, the two maidens ran quickly to the castle for help, and soon they came back with a throng of anxious knights and ladies. Tenderly they bore the weeping Herodys back to the castle and placed her on her couch, where she lay like one who has been dazed by some great sorrow.</p>
<p>When word of all this was carried to Sir Orfeo, he hastened with all speed to his lady’s bower, and great was his wonder and grief to see the sad change in her.</p>
<p>“Alas!” he said, “what hath gone amiss? Look up, dear wife, and tell me what this may mean. Art thou my gentle Herodys, and now dost lie so cold and still? Are these thine eyes that look upon me as though I were a stranger and thy foe? Take heart, dear wife, and tell me now the cause of all thy grief.”</p>
<p>At these and other kind words of Sir Orfeo, the Lady Herodys at length took courage, and soon she began to speak.</p>
<p>“Sorrow has come upon us, Sir Orfeo,” said she. “This many a day hast thou cherished me, and as truly have I loved thee. But now no more may we think of that, for soon must we part in twain. This day the call has come to me.”</p>
<p>“What words are these! “ exclaimed Sir Orfeo; “and why speakest thou so strangely? If thou must away from me, whither wilt thou go and to whom? But I know thou canst not mean it so, for wherever thou goest, far or near, there truly shall I go with thee.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” answered Herodys, “that is even the heaviest of my sorrow, that now thou canst not go with me. Listen, and I will tell thee all how the summons has come to me. Even this day I have been called, and to-morrow in the morning I must away. For thus it was that this day as I lay and slept on the fresh green grass beneath one of my garden trees, behold two fair knights suddenly appeared to me. Well arrayed they were in all good knightly gear, and courteous were their words when they spake to me and bade me come without delay to speak with their master the king. Then I answered these two knights boldly enough, and said that I neither could nor would come to speak with their stranger king. They paused not, but away they sped when I had thus spoken. Quickly they were back, and with them rode a band wonderful to see. Well-nigh a thousand of the fairest knights and ladies came trooping over the garden lawns, and among them came riding their king. On snow-white steeds all this band were seated, and white as the lily-flower were the shining garments that each one wore. A bright crown, gleamed on the head of the king, not made of silver or of gold, but all of precious stones that shone like the sun in the heavens when the sky is most clear.</p>
<p>“Light as thistle-down in the wind they rode, and when all this band of white-robed knights and ladies had reached the place where I lay beneath my garden tree, the king placed me beside him on his own milk-white steed. In the flashing of an eye we were off, the whole bright troop together. The silver bells jingled in the wind and away we sped through forest and field, past river and brook, past mountain and mead, until at last we came to a strange land the like of which mortal eye hath never seen. In the center of the land there rose the wondrous palace of this king. With pinnacles and towers it shone, all built of the white marble stone, and about it spread green meadows and fields and fair gardens as far as eye could see. The flowers were springing and the birds were singing, and here, if anywhere, the days seemed happy and free.</p>
<p>“Then this king showed me everything, his halls all spangled with crystal gems like the stars that shine in the night, and all his sweet meadows and gardens and fields, where countless number of his folk led their lives in pleasure and peace. Suddenly he placed me again on his milk-white steed, and back from this land we sped, past village and town, past river and mountain, until he had brought me to my own garden here, and placed me again beneath my tree. ‘To-morrow I shall come for thee,’ were his last words to me, ‘and see that I find thee beneath thy tree. To the other-world thou must wend, and dwell forever in my land.’ With these words this king disappeared, and all the white steeds and all the fair folk in their glistening garments who had ridden thither with him. Then I awoke, and grief was at my heart, for at last the call had come to me. To-morrow I must leave thee, and whither I go, thou canst not come.”</p>
<p>When Sir Orfeo had heard all this strange story, he saw well that he had need of wise counsel.</p>
<p>“Rather it had been my life,” said he, sorrowfully, “than that the Lady Herodys should be borne away from me. Yet truly that shall not be done, if the might of my hand can aught avail.”</p>
<p>Since he had not the wisdom of the other-world, Sir Orfeo was resolute to use all he had of this, and when the morrow was come, and the hour which the king had set for his tryst, then he took all his companions in arms—a hundred or more they were—and with swords in their hands and armor on their backs, they surrounded the Lady Herodys beneath her garden tree. Sadly the lady smiled, for well she knew that this was all in vain, and that by no such arts could the other-world king be prevented of his will. And then, while the knights stood waiting with swords in their hands for their enemy to appear, suddenly before their eyes, they knew not how, the lady was twitched away from them and was no more to be seen. The swords clashed on one another, or struck emptily at the thin air, but no foe was there for mortal hands to harm. Silently and wonderingly the knights gazed at each other. But the Lady Herodys was gone, and naught was there to do but lead the hapless Sir Orfeo back to his castle halls, all desolate and empty now.</p>
<p>From this very hour when the Lady Herodys was borne away, a great change came over Sir Orfeo. All his days were now spent in revery and solitude. More and more he put his subjects and his lands and his cattle into the care of his faithful steward, and he himself withdrew apart from all men to the quiet rooms of his castle. All the cares and pastimes which of old had made his days so bright and stirring were now forgotten except one, and this one was the playing of the harp. To his harp alone Sir Orfeo told all the grief of his heart, and it was in his harp that he found his only relief from pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>It happened at length that Sir Orfeo broke his silence, and calling all his people together, he told them what he was now minded to do.</p>
<p>“Friends and companions,” said he to them, “I now appoint my steward here to rule in my stead. Obey him and serve him, if ye will show your love to me. And when, as time goes by, ye shall learn that Sir Orfeo no longer lives and moves upon this earth, then call ye a meeting of all my folk and choose from among yourselves one to be your ruler and prince. Now I must away. No longer shall I look upon the faces of my friends, but deep in the forest and far from the haunts of men I shall take up my dwelling-place. I have lost that which all this world cannot restore, and from this day I renounce all that this world has yet to give.”</p>
<p>With sorrow the people heard these words of their good prince, and all besought him to take comfort for his loss, and not to leave them for the hard and desolate life of the pathless forest. But Sir Orfeo was not to be turned from his will. He bade them all farewell, and with nothing but his harp in his hands and his cloak upon his shoulders, he set forth on his solitary way.</p>
<p>A strange life was this that Sir Orfeo now led. He who had once been lord of a hundred knights, now wandered forth alone, as poor as the poorest hermit in the land. When the night came, he had naught to shelter him but the leaves and boughs of the forest. The rain and the sun of the heavens were free to beat upon him, and no shelter he knew from the winds, however boisterous and blustering. No eager servers now set rich food before him in bright silver dishes, as in the old days in his castle, but with the labor of his hands he must search for roots and herbs and such other hard fare as the forest yields to answer the needs of the body.</p>
<p>But all was not hardship for Sir Orfeo in the life of the forest. Now again his heart was quiet, and in the still afternoons, or when the night was clear and the stars were glittering in the black sky, then Sir Orfeo would take his harp and play on it. Not for the praise of men did he play, for men there were not in the forest to hear him. Sir Orfeo’s music was like the music of the breeze in the tall grass, and like the singing of many waters as they slip over the mossy rocks beneath the shadows of the trees. The very birds of the forest, unafraid, drew near to listen to his harping, and the timorous creatures forgot their tremblings, and the wild beasts of ravin ceased to pursue their prey beneath the sway of the sweet harmony.</p>
<p>Thus many a long day Sir Orfeo dwelt, a lonely exile, in the depths of the silent and mysterious forests. With his harp as his only companion, he wandered here and wandered there, always thinking of his lost Herodys and hoping some day to find her. But very slowly were Sir Orfeo’s eyes opened, and for a long time never a trace did he meet with of her who had been taken from him. Only now and then, far down the dim aisles of the forest, he heard the faint sounds of elfin horns blowing, soft and echoing, and then he knew that the other-world king was hunting with his train in the forest. And once or twice it seemed to him that, through the tangled screen of thick leaves, he caught the shimmer of white steeds and of white-robed riders as they sped silently through the dusky forest, but so silently and swiftly that it was vain to seek to follow after them.</p>
<p>But it chanced one twilight eve that fortune favored Sir Orfeo unexpectedly. For as he drew near the edge of the shadowy trees that circled a little round lawn in the center of the forest, behold, all at once he saw through the leaves the other-world king and all his band of followers. Hiding behind the trees, eagerly Sir Orfeo gazed at one after the other, seeking for the face of the one dearest to him. Then at last he beheld the Lady Herodys. With a cry he started forward, when all was suddenly changed. The spell was broken, and the king and his folk formed a circle about the Lady Herodys, so that Sir Orfeo no longer could see her. Like the little waves of the sea with the moonlight on them, the whole glistening band went dancing away down the dark lanes of the forest, with Sir Orfeo following after them.</p>
<p>“Not now shall ye escape me,” cried Sir Orfeo, “for with my life will I pay to know whither ye are wending!”</p>
<p>Over stock and stone they went, over hill and hollow, until at last, in the bright moonlight, Sir Orfeo saw the whole troop speed through a narrow opening in a rock wall that rose up gray and forbidding. Well might a man pause before he risked his life in such a grim and gruesome region. But Sir Orfeo heeded not the rock cliffs, nor the dim caverns in the wall, such as fiery dragons seek out for their place of hiding, and boldly he hastened forward in quest of the bright throng which had passed in before him. Now when Sir Orfeo had almost lost strength and courage in the darkness of this rocky pass, at length the way became smoother and the light of the place less somber; and then, all at once, the grim walls broke off sheer and steep, and Sir Orfeo stepped forth on the soft turf of a level meadow. There no hill lifted its head, nor any dale was sunk in the level of the wide fields, but far as eye could reach, the smooth lawns spread abroad like a green ocean. Sun nor moon sent forth their light within that land, and yet it was always afternoon. There the winds of winter never blew harsh and keen, and the bitter sleet and hail never fell, nor was it ever too hot or too cold, but the summer skies were forever soft and serene.</p>
<p>A land of enchantment Sir Orfeo thought he had reached as he made his way over the smooth fields. Many a crystal brook he passed, with the silver fishes darting from pool to pool, and many a bird sang on branch and limb. The air was sweet with the scent of numberless blooms, and all manner of bright fruits hung heavily from the branches of the trees. On and on Sir Orfeo sped, and the farther he went, the greater his wonder grew. Here, he thought, one could never grow weary, and a year in this land seemed less than a minute of the day. Strangest of all he thought it that in this happy land naught but the birds and gentle creatures of the forest and field were to be seen.</p>
<p>A country strangely abandoned by its people Sir Orfeo had almost concluded this to be, when all at once before him as he went he saw the walls of a fair castle rise. Bright and gleaming they were, for they were made of crystal of purest ray, all set in silver and gold, and the high towers and pinnacles, all quaintly carved, shone in the dear light like the vision of a dream. Within these castle walls Sir Orfeo heard the gay sound of revelry. There was music of the pipe and tabor, and from afar he heard the high strain of the minstrel’s song. Loudly Sir Orfeo knocked at the castle gate, and straightway all within became silent as death.</p>
<p>“Who knocks so boldly at my gate?” the porter shouted from the other side.</p>
<p>“Here am I,” answered Sir Orfeo, “a poor minstrel come into thy land. Open thy gate and let me in, and with my minstrel’s art I will pay thy courtesy.”</p>
<p>The bolts slid back, the door flew open, and Sir Orfeo gazed upon the scene within. Everywhere he saw folk sitting, all still now and speechless as the dead. They turned not nor stirred, but a deep spell held them in its sway. Here and there Sir Orfeo eagerly turned his gaze, and at last, with grief and joy, he beheld the end of all his quest. For there, beneath a young tree such as the unhappy one which had grown in his own castle garden, the Lady Herodys lay, fair as the day she was borne from his side. No bitter wind of winter had touched her bright face, nor had she known the wasting sorrow that had made Sir Orfeo so gaunt and gray. Time and change they knew not in this land, where all was as the king of the other-world willed.</p>
<p>“Alas! “ said Sir Orfeo, “how shall I ever win my lady back? She speaks not, nor are her eyes turned to meet mine. Much I fear I have found her but to lose her again.”</p>
<p>Little time had Sir Orfeo for such musings, for as he thought to turn toward the Lady Herodys, straightway many folk were at his side, and there among them stood the other-world king. Courteously Sir Orfeo bent his knee and begged the king to listen to his minstrelsy.</p>
<p>“What man art thou,” demanded the king, “that comest unbidden here? Never during the time I have ruled within this realm hath mortal man been so bold to come hither before I have sent for him.”</p>
<p>“Truly, Sir King,” in reply Sir Orfeo said, “it is the custom of such as I am to visit the dwellings of great men and kings, and there, with such art as we have, win a welcome for our coming.”</p>
<p>“If it be as thou sayest,” then said the king, “now sit thee down and see what welcome thou canst win here in this land of the blest.”</p>
<p>Without more words, Sir Orfeo sat him down and took his harp in his hands and began to play.</p>
<p>He played all the songs he had learned in his lonely life in the wildwood, and he played the grief he had felt for the loss of the Lady Herodys —all that touches the heart of man he played before the other-world king.</p>
<p>When Sir Orfeo had finished and had put down his harp, then the king stirred and spoke to him: “Welcome and thrice welcome art thou here, for human though thou art, thou hast magic in thy harp. Speak now, and ask whatever boon thou wilt have, for that will I give thee in pay for thy sweet harping.”</p>
<p>“O! King,” cried Sir Orfeo, joyfully, “then give me that fair lady of mine that lieth so still beneath yonder tree.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” replied the king, “that truly were not a fair exchange. For look, her hue is soft and bright as a white swan’s wing, and thou art uncouthly rough, and hast a beard like a wild man of the wood. An ill deed it were to mate such loveliness with such an one as thou art.”</p>
<p>“Truly hast thou said,” answered Sir Orfeo, “that I am rough of figure and of face, and all unworthy such a mate as I have asked of thee. But yet methinks it were an ill deed, too, for a king to make a promise, and afterward to fail in the keeping of it.”</p>
<p>“Now it is thou who hast spoken the truth! “ exclaimed the king. “Thou shalt have what thou desirest. Take back now thy chosen one to the land of men, for here I loose my power over her. Arise, fair Herodys, and live as this man lives.”</p>
<p>With these words the king and his folk and the glistening palace all disappeared, but Sir Orfeo waited not to wonder what had become of them. He look the Lady Herodys by the hand, and quickly traced again the path he had followed into that land. He crossed the level fields so soft and green, and found at last the narrow way among the frowning cliffs. Down this they sped, hand in hand, and great was their joy when at its end they left the gruesome shadows at their backs and stepped forth into the light of the cheerful sun.</p>
<p>Having won back the Lady Herodys, now again Sir Orfeo was ready to seek out his old friends, and with all speed they set out for the land of the Grecians. When they had reached the town in which his castle stood, Sir Orfeo took his dwelling in a humble man’s cot, and pretended to be what he seemed, a poor wandering minstrel just come into the land. From this humble cotter Sir Orfeo learned tidings of all that had befallen since the day the Lady Herodys had been borne away, and how in all things the steward had governed wisely and well the people and estates that had been intrusted to him.</p>
<p>Now, the next day, Sir Orfeo thought he would test for himself the faithfulness of his good steward. Dressed as a harper, he met the steward in the street and said:</p>
<p>“Have pity, I pray, on a minstrel old and poor; from a far country have I come, and great is my need.”</p>
<p>“Come thou home with me,” the steward straightway replied. “Never a minstrel shall ask in vain for help in this land. For the love of Sir Orfeo, the best of harpers this world has ever seen, a right good welcome shall all minstrels have of me.”</p>
<p>Then the steward took Sir Orfeo into his hall, and they sat down to meat, and there was mirth and comfort for all.</p>
<p>After the dinner was over, Sir Orfeo took up his harp and began to play. No such playing had ever been heard in that hall before, and all were filled with wonder at the music. But then the steward looked more closely, and soon he saw that this was the very harp his master used to play.</p>
<p>“Now tell me, minstrel,” he cried aloud, “how hast thou come by the harp thou usest so well?”</p>
<p>“This harp I found in a forest dale,” the minstrel said; “I picked it up where it lay beside a perished man, and since that day methinks a full ten years has passed by.”</p>
<p>“Alas, alas!” the steward cried. “That can have been none other than our good prince Sir Orfeo.”</p>
<p>When Sir Orfeo saw the grief of the steward and understood how faithful he had been in all his trust, he started up and told him who he was, and how he had brought the Lady Herodys back with him, and that now never would he leave his people masterless again. The news of all this quickly spread abroad, and with great joy the people thronged about, and soon in stately procession they set out for the humble cot and brought back the Lady Herodys within the castle walls. And here, again surrounded by their faithful followers and their long-tried and loyal friends, Sir Orfeo and the Lady Herodys took up the thread of their old life, and many happy years they lived together. Many, too, were the strange adventures they encountered in the course of their days, but of all the marvels that they met with, none was more wonderful than this—that once, by the power of his music, Sir Orfeo won his way to the kingdom of the other-world, and from that mysterious realm brought back the Lady Herodys to the land of the living.</p>

<p>Sir Orfeo
by Hunt, Edward Eyre, 1885-</p>
<p>Publication date 1909</p>
<p>pp1-32</p>
<p>Sir Orfeo</p>
<p>We often read with new delight<br />
The lays that clerks would have us know,<br />
For lays there are that sing aright<br />
Each wondrous thing of long ago:<br />
Some are of weal, and some of woe,<br />
And some of joy and gentle mirth,<br />
And some of guile and treacherous foe,<br />
And some the strangest haps of earth;</p>
<p>Some are of jests and ribaldry,<br />
And some there are of fairy lore;<br />
But most of all, as men may see,<br />
They sing of love and trials sore.<br />
In Britain in the days of yore<br />
The harpers writ that men should praise<br />
The gallant deeds that were before —<br />
Of such the Britons made their lays.</p>
<p>And that we all should featly hold<br />
In heart the mirth of elder days,<br />
Some took their harps and gaily told<br />
Of olden loves in tender lays.<br />
I know not all their subtle ways;<br />
I tell the little that I know;<br />
So hearken, lords, your poet prays,<br />
And I will sing of Orfeo.</p>
<p>Sir Orfeo, a king was he,<br />
And in his time a mighty man,<br />
Stalwart and strong and masterly,<br />
A kind and courteous Christian.<br />
To King Pluto his lineage ran,<br />
His mother from Queen Juno sprung;<br />
Men called them gods when time began<br />
For lofty deeds they did and sung.</p>
<p>Orfeo most of any king<br />
Loved a harper and his lay;<br />
Every harper there might sing,<br />
Honoured if he chose to stay.<br />
And the king himself would play,<br />
Singing with a merry mind.<br />
And, as all the gleemen say,<br />
A better harper none could find.</p>
<p>None before him was, I trow,<br />
Or in after days will be<br />
Held the peer of Orfeo<br />
When he struck his harp. And he<br />
Who could hear that minstrelsy<br />
Would have deemed his spirit were<br />
Housed in Heaven, such melody<br />
Was it, and such joy to hear.</p>
<p>Thrace they named his stout demesne,<br />
Then the strongest of cities;<br />
With him dwelt his gracious queen,<br />
Called the Lady Heurodis,<br />
Fairest of all fair ladies;<br />
Naught surpassed her gentleness,<br />
Full of love and courtesies;<br />
None can tell her loveliness.</p>
<p>And in the merry month of May<br />
When day is fraught with happy hours,<br />
When wintry storms have passed away,<br />
And every field is full of flowers,<br />
When clustered blossoms deck the bowers,<br />
And morn is made to spend in sport,<br />
Sweet Heurodis went from her towers<br />
With two fair maidens of the court,</p>
<p>And out into the air of spring,<br />
To revel in a grove, and see<br />
The lovely blossoms bourgeoning,<br />
And linnets piping cheerily.<br />
At last, beneath a spreading tree,<br />
They sat them down in grasses deep,<br />
And soon — the maids watched at her knee —<br />
The queen was lying fast asleep.</p>
<p>They feared to waken her too soon,<br />
So let her lie in sweet repose.<br />
She slept till it was afternoon,<br />
And morn had gone, as morning goes;<br />
Then sudden with a cry she rose<br />
And burst in tears of wild despair,<br />
And wrung her hands, and showered blows<br />
Upon her breast, and tore her hair.</p>
<p>Her jewelled robe she seized and rent,<br />
For she was frantic in her pain.<br />
The maids in their bewilderment<br />
No longer dared with her remain,<br />
But to the palace ran again<br />
And summoned every squire and knight,<br />
And bade them haste with might and main<br />
To aid their mistress in her plight.</p>
<p>Knights, pages, squires, and ladies too,<br />
And damsels hasten from the wall;<br />
Into the orchard quick they go,<br />
And, fearful of what may befall,<br />
They lift and bear her to the hall<br />
And moaning on her pillows lay;<br />
Yet wild and heedless still of all<br />
Ever she strove to flee away.</p>
<p>Sir Orf eo, when he was told,<br />
Was as he ne’er before had been;<br />
With all his knights he entered bold<br />
Into the chamber of the queen,<br />
But when he saw, he cried in teen,<br />
“Ah, dearest wife, what afleth thee?<br />
Thee joyless I have never seen,<br />
Yet now thou wailest dreadfully.</p>
<p>“Thy lovely body, once so bright,<br />
Is bruised as if thou wished thee dead.<br />
Alas! alas! how wan and white<br />
Thy little mouth that was so red!<br />
And dark with blood thy nails have shed<br />
Thy fingers that were erst as snow!<br />
Thy lovely eyes are full of dread<br />
And gaze as if I were thy foe!</p>
<p>“ Cease, Dearest, I implore thee now<br />
These cries that all the palace fill,<br />
And tell me what hath been, and how,<br />
Or who hath done thee aught of ill.”<br />
At last she ceased and lay full still,<br />
And weeping bitter tears of woe,<br />
She answered at his royal will,<br />
“Alas! my lord, Sir Orfeo,</p>
<p>“ Since we were first together, naught<br />
Hath marred our life; no smallest sign;<br />
But we have loved as love we ought;<br />
Thou art my life, and I am thine.<br />
Now do thy best and do not pine,<br />
For we must part, and I to doom ! “<br />
“ Alas ! “ he cried, and “ woe is mine !<br />
Where dost thou go, Love, and to whom?</p>
<p>“Whither thou goest I will go,<br />
And where I go thou too shalt fare ! “<br />
“ Nay, nay, my lord ; thou dost not know :<br />
My doom no mortal man may share.<br />
This morn, as I was lying there<br />
Asleep beneath an orchard-tree,<br />
Two gallant horsemen, young and fair,<br />
Rode to my feet, and bent the knee,</p>
<p>“ And bade me come with haste and speed<br />
To parley with their lord the king.<br />
But I replied I durst not heed,<br />
Nor would I come for any thing.<br />
Then they departed galloping,<br />
And came the king with all his court:<br />
Knights and fair damsels in a ring,<br />
All clothed in white of wondrous sort.</p>
<p>“ I never in my life before<br />
Have seen such creatures as they were.<br />
Upon his head the monarch wore<br />
A crown, but nought of gold was there:<br />
It was a precious jewel rare,<br />
And blazed as brightly as the sun;<br />
And when he came, he spoke me fair,<br />
And though I wept, he placed me on</p>
<p>“ A steed. And so I rode away<br />
Upon a palfrey by his side.<br />
He brought me to his palace gay;<br />
More beautiful I never spied.<br />
He showed me castles, rivers wide,<br />
Towers, and vast forests, mead and plain.<br />
Again to horse, again we ride,<br />
And so he brought me home again.</p>
<p>“And hither to our orchard borne<br />
He let me down and said to me,<br />
‘ See, lady, that to-morrow morn<br />
Thou art beneath this self-same tree;<br />
Then thou shalt go with us and be<br />
For aye with us in fairy land;<br />
And if thou failest, woe to thee,<br />
For thou shalt feel the fairies’ hand ! ‘</p>
<p>“ ‘ Where’er thou art thy limbs shall fail,<br />
No man shalt thou find piteous;<br />
Thou shalt be torn with tooth and nail,<br />
And would thou hadst returned with us!’”<br />
When Orfeo had heard, he was<br />
Distraught, and moaned, “ Alas ! my life,<br />
Dearer than life, and must I thus<br />
Lose thee, my queen, my love, my wife?”</p>
<p>He sought for counsel: all were dumb,<br />
For none could proffer words of good.<br />
At last the morrow morn had come,<br />
And Orfeo in armour stood<br />
With hundreds of his knightlihood,<br />
Each armed and harnessed, stout and grim;<br />
They sallied forth into the wood<br />
And girt about the queen and him.</p>
<p>In close array they stood at guard<br />
And swore upon their weapons keen<br />
They each should die upon the sward<br />
Ere aught should come and take the queen.<br />
Yet from their circle, and unseen,<br />
The woeful Heurodis was won.<br />
Alas! naught was where she had been,<br />
And none could tell where she had gone.</p>
<p>Then there was wailing wild and dread;<br />
The king into his chamber went,<br />
And oft he swooned upon her bed,<br />
And made such dole and such lament<br />
His very life was wellnigh spent<br />
Ere he could find a space for words;<br />
Then woefully he rose, and sent<br />
For all his barons, earls, and lords.</p>
<p>When they had come in solemn train,<br />
“ My lords,” he said, “ all ye have seen ;<br />
Hear now: my steward I ordain<br />
To rule throughout my broad demesne.<br />
He shall be lord as I have been,<br />
And I must wander hence forlorn,<br />
For I have lost the fairest queen<br />
And sweetest lady ever born.</p>
<p>“No other lady shall I see;<br />
Forth must I fare on woeful quest<br />
To dwell where never man may be,<br />
Of beasts and birds to be the guest.<br />
And when ye know my soul has rest,<br />
Call then yourselves a parliament,<br />
And choose a king as seems you best.<br />
Do all as this my testament.”</p>
<p>Then there was wailing in the hall;<br />
Men wept as there were no surcease,<br />
And not a man among them all<br />
Might speak for tears. Upon their knees<br />
They knelt and made their woeful pleas,<br />
Beseeching him he would not go,<br />
Else were they desolate. But, “ Cease,”<br />
Answered the king; “it shall be so!”</p>
<p>And so his kingdom he forsook;<br />
He had no kirtle and no hood;<br />
A simple palmer’s cloak he took;<br />
No shoes he had, no store of food.<br />
But with his harp he sadly strode<br />
Barefooted from the castle gate,<br />
Alone to wander where he would.<br />
Alas! how woeful was his state!</p>
<p>Alas! the wailing in the hall,<br />
When he that had been king with crown,<br />
Went like a beggar from them all.<br />
In poverty he left the town;<br />
Through wood and waste and dreary down<br />
And towards the wilds he set his face;<br />
Now found he deserts bleak and brown<br />
And naught to ease his woeful case.</p>
<p>He that had worn but garments gay<br />
And slumbered in a purple bed,<br />
Now on the barren heather lay,<br />
His couch with leaves and grasses spread.<br />
He that had castles turreted,<br />
Rivers, and forests, fields, and flowers,<br />
Now had the snow and sleet instead,<br />
And passed in woe his weary hours.</p>
<p>He that had scores of gentle knights<br />
And ladies at his beck and call,<br />
Now saw but dread unhappy sights,<br />
Serpents and beasts that creep and crawl.<br />
He that had supped in bower and hall<br />
On dainty dishes and sweet fruits,<br />
Now must he dig to find a small<br />
Repast of herbs and bitter roots.</p>
<p>In summer, fruits of every kind<br />
He had, and berries from the bough;<br />
In winter, nothing could he find<br />
But roots and leaves beneath the snow.<br />
His form was bent, his pace was slow,<br />
And he was worn by tempests sore.<br />
Ah, who can tell the pain and woe<br />
This king endured ten years and more!</p>
<p>His beard, that once was black and trim,<br />
Was white, and lengthened to his knee;<br />
His harp that ever solaced him,<br />
He hid within a hollow tree;<br />
And when the day was clear and free<br />
He took it forth, and musing played,<br />
And when the gentle melody<br />
Was echoed far through gorse and glade,</p>
<p>The wildest creatures hidden there<br />
For very joy about him played,<br />
And all the birds from everywhere<br />
Came forth and heard; for all obeyed<br />
The witching music that he made,<br />
Such perfect melody it was;<br />
And when he ceased, they fled afraid<br />
And hid them, wild and timorous.</p>
<p>And oft on dewy summer morns<br />
Sir Orfeo beheld at hand<br />
The fairy king, and heard the horns<br />
Of hunting, and his shouting band<br />
A-ranging wide across the land<br />
With barking hounds; yet never game<br />
He saw them take, nor heard a stand, —<br />
Nor never knew he whence they came.</p>
<p>He saw across the hazy heights<br />
A mighty host another day:<br />
A thousand well-accoutred knights<br />
Went riding ready for the fray.<br />
Bright were their ranks, with large display<br />
Of gorgeous banners gaily blent;<br />
Each brandished sword in that array, —<br />
Yet never knew he where they went.</p>
<p>Again, he saw a wondrous rout<br />
Of knights and ladies dancing free,<br />
In quaint attire, and in and out<br />
They wove and wandered daintily,<br />
To sound of pipes and minstrelsy<br />
And every kind of music sweet.<br />
One day he saw a galaxy<br />
Of ladies ride by his retreat;</p>
<p>Gentle and sweet they were, he wist,<br />
And not a man rode in their train;<br />
Each had a falcon on her wrist,<br />
And to the river in the plain<br />
They passed.  The prey rose up amain,<br />
Cormorants, herons, mallards flew;<br />
The falcons soared with proud disdain,<br />
Stooped, and each hawk his quarry slew.</p>
<p>“Ho!” laughed the king, “there is fair game!<br />
I too will see their gay intent,<br />
For I was wont to do the same.”<br />
He rose in haste and thither went,<br />
And to a beauteous lady bent<br />
His steps, when lo! he starts, he sees<br />
Dumb with a like astonishment,<br />
His stolen queen, sweet Heurodis.</p>
<p>For when she saw that it was he<br />
She neither spoke nor uttered cry,<br />
He was so spent with misery<br />
That once had been so rich and high.<br />
And then she wept as if to die,<br />
But quick the others caught her rein,<br />
And closed about, and made her fly,<br />
And would not let her there remain.</p>
<p>“ Alas ! alas ! “ he gan to cry,<br />
“Why will not death dispel my pain?<br />
Alas! alas! would I could die<br />
Now I have seen my love again.<br />
Alas, that I must live, who fain<br />
Would perish! for I dared not speak<br />
To her, nor she to me. Ah, vain<br />
Is life ; alas ! my heart will break ! “</p>
<p>“But nay,” he cried at last, “not so:<br />
I too shall wend, tide what betide,<br />
Whither these gentle ladies go,<br />
And learn the spot where they abide!<br />
He took his cloak and harp, and hied<br />
Him forth, his harp upon his back,<br />
Nor stock nor stone could turn aside<br />
His footsteps from that beaten track.</p>
<p>In at a rock the ladies rode,<br />
And fearlessly he followed fast.<br />
When far into the rock he strode,<br />
It grew more bright, and so at last<br />
Into a far countree he passed,<br />
Bright as the fairest summer sun:<br />
All smooth and plain and green and vast,<br />
For hills and valleys were there none.</p>
<p>Amid the land a castle tall<br />
And rich and proud and wondrous high<br />
Uprose, and all the outmost wall<br />
Shone as a crystal to the eye.<br />
A hundred towers lit up the sky,<br />
Of diamond all battled stout;<br />
And buttresses rose up near by<br />
Arched with red gold and broad about.</p>
<p>All the bonsour was carved in stone<br />
With every beast and every wight,<br />
And all within the castle shone<br />
And sparkled with unearthly light.<br />
The meanest pillars to the sight<br />
Seemed every whit of burnished gold.<br />
And all that land was warm and bright,<br />
For when our earth is dark and cold,</p>
<p>The jewelled stones shed forth a light<br />
Like sunbeams on a summer’s day.<br />
None may describe that wondrous sight<br />
Or sculptured work so proud and gay;<br />
But one would think that rich array<br />
Were of the courts of Paradise.<br />
Therein the ladies led the way;<br />
He followed fast in sweet surprise.</p>
<p>When at the gate, Sir Orfeo<br />
Knocked, and the porter came anear<br />
And asked what he would have him do.<br />
“Parfay, I am a minstrel here,”<br />
He said, “ to please thy lord with cheer,<br />
If he will deign to summon me.”<br />
The porter lent a willing ear<br />
And led him in the castle free.</p>
<p>There as he gazed his glances fell<br />
On many marvels all around;<br />
Folk long thought dead were by a spell<br />
Brought hither, and as living found:<br />
Some headless stood upon the ground,<br />
Some had no arms, and some were torn<br />
With dreadful wounds, and some lay bound<br />
Fast to the earth in hap forlorn.</p>
<p>And some full-armed on horses sat,<br />
And some were strangled as at meat,<br />
And some were drowned as in a vat,<br />
And some were burned with fiery heat,<br />
Wives lay in child-bed, maidens sweet<br />
Were there, and other marvels more;<br />
Each wondrous wight was at his feet<br />
As each had slumbered long before.</p>
<p>Each thus was stolen out of life,<br />
For such the fairies seize and keep.<br />
And there he saw his darling wife,<br />
Sweet Heurodis, as one asleep<br />
Beneath a tree in grasses deep,<br />
For by her garb he knew it all;<br />
And when he saw, he fain would weep,<br />
But entered bold into the hall.</p>
<p>And there he saw a seemly thing,<br />
A tabernacle fair and light,<br />
Whereunder sat the fairy king,<br />
Near him his queen, a lovely wight.<br />
Their crowns, their garments, glistened bright;<br />
He could not gaze, so hot they shone;<br />
And when he saw that noble sight,<br />
He knelt him down before the throne,</p>
<p>And said, “Lord, if thou wilt allow,<br />
My melody shall pleasure thee.”<br />
The king replied, “ What man art thou<br />
That hither comes? and for what plea?<br />
I did not send, nor none with me<br />
Hath bid thee come to fairy lond.<br />
My faith, I never yet did see<br />
Since I was crowned, a man so fond</p>
<p>“ As thou who durst us so defy,<br />
„ And comest lacking summons true.”<br />
“Lord,” answered he, “know this; that I<br />
As a poor simple minstrel sue.<br />
And, sir, it is our custom to<br />
Seek out the hall of many a lord;<br />
Though we be welcome to but few,<br />
Sweet is the music we afford.”</p>
<p>He sat him down before the king<br />
And all the court in rich array;<br />
He took his merry harp to sing,<br />
And when he gan that blissful lay,<br />
All crowded to his feet, and they<br />
That were without the palace, lo!<br />
They came to hear the minstrel play,<br />
To hear the lay of Orfeo.</p>
<p>The king was pleased and sat full still,<br />
Right gladly did he hear the glee;<br />
The lovely queen with right good will<br />
Joyed in the lovely melody.<br />
And when it ceased at last, “Thy fee,”<br />
The king exclaimed, “ for, harper mine,<br />
I love thy tender minstrelsy:<br />
Ask what thou wilt, and it is thine;</p>
<p>“ Largess I proffer for thy task ;<br />
Speak now, what shall I give to thee? “<br />
“ Sir,” answered he, “ one thing I ask ;<br />
This — that thou wilt bestow on me<br />
The lady ‘neath the orchard-tree<br />
A-slumbering in grasses deep.”<br />
“Nay,” quoth the king, “that cannot be;<br />
A sorry couple ye would keep.</p>
<p>“ For thou art rough, and foul, and lean,<br />
But lovely as a rose is she.<br />
‘Twere lothly thing to let a queen<br />
Be partner of thy company.”<br />
“Oh, sir,” he cried, “thy courtesy,<br />
But surely ‘twere a fouler thing<br />
To hear thy lips lie thus to me!<br />
So, sir, my boon, as thou art king!</p>
<p>“ I have but asked of thee my due,<br />
And thou must needs requite me so.”<br />
The king replied, “ Aye, it is true ;<br />
Then take her by the hand and go.<br />
Joy have of her and never woe ! “<br />
He thanked him sweet, and by the hand<br />
He led his wife; thus Orfeo<br />
And Heurodis left fairy land.</p>
<p>They wandered from that woeful place<br />
That wrought them so much misery,<br />
Along the way that led to Thrace,<br />
His high demesne, his own city;<br />
And no man knew that it was he.<br />
Then paused they at the city’s end;<br />
For fear of fraud and treachery<br />
That day no further would they wend.</p>
<p>In at a beggar’s, poor and old,<br />
Who dwelt a space beyond the wall,<br />
He and his lady turned, and told<br />
How he was but a minstrel-thrall;<br />
He asked the beggar news of all<br />
That had befallen: who was king,<br />
Or who the ruler in the hall:<br />
The beggar told him everything.</p>
<p>How the fair queen was rapt away<br />
Ten years agone, by fairy spell;<br />
And how the king the self-same day<br />
Had gone; none knew where he might dwell;<br />
And how the steward ruled full well;<br />
And many other things he told.<br />
Then Orfeo left the beggar’s cell<br />
And Heurodis with the beggar old.</p>
<p>Straightway the beggar’s rags he took;<br />
He took his merry harp, and went<br />
Into the town, where all might look<br />
Upon his body soiled and bent.<br />
Men laughed aloud in merriment;<br />
The ladies, earls, and barons said,<br />
“ Lo, see the man ! his hair is sprent<br />
Like moss about his shaggy head;</p>
<p>“ His beard is fallen to his feet<br />
Like weathered ivy tumbling down ! “<br />
There as he went, he chanced to meet<br />
His steward coming through the town.<br />
Then loud he cried, and plucked his gown,<br />
“ Sir steward, hearken, pity me !<br />
I am a harper of renown;<br />
Ah, help me in my misery ! “</p>
<p>The steward straightway answered, “ Come !<br />
Thou shalt share aught I can bestow.<br />
Every good harper is welcome<br />
For my lord’s sake Sir Orfeo.”<br />
Straight to the castle then they go,<br />
And all the lords sat down to meat;<br />
Trumpets and tabours blare and blow;<br />
Gleemen and crowders sang full sweet.</p>
<p>And much of melody they had,<br />
But Orfeo heard it silently.<br />
When all was still, the steward bade<br />
Him take his harp and sing his glee.<br />
He touched it soft, and melody<br />
Sweeter than ever tongue can tell,<br />
Delighted all that company.<br />
The steward heard and marked it well.</p>
<p>He knew the harp, and said, “ Say now,<br />
Minstrel, as thou hast fear of Hell,<br />
Where gottest thou thy harp, and how?<br />
I pray thee haste and quickly tell ! “<br />
“ Lord,” quoth he, “ in a desert fell<br />
As I was wandering one morn,<br />
I found within a dismal dell<br />
A corse by angry lions torn.</p>
<p>“The wolves had gnawed him flesh and bone;<br />
His harp was lying in the snow.<br />
‘Tis full ten weary years agone.”<br />
“ Oh,” cried the steward, “ dost thou know<br />
That was my lord, Sir Orfeo!<br />
Alas! now am I all forlorn.<br />
My lord is lost! ah, me is woe!<br />
Ah, would that I had ne’er been born ! “</p>
<p>He fell a-swooning to the ground;<br />
His barons caught him up again,<br />
And sought to heal his woeful wound,<br />
And give him comfort in his pain,<br />
But still he mourned, for all was vain.<br />
And when Sir Orfeo well knew<br />
His steward’s love had not a stain,<br />
He rose, and spake, and nearer drew.</p>
<p>“ Sir steward, hearken now and hear :<br />
If I were Orfeo the king,<br />
And had sore suffered many a year,<br />
Enduring every cruel thing,<br />
And by my lays at last could bring<br />
My queen from fairy land again,<br />
And now had left her sorrowing<br />
In a poor hovel in the plain,</p>
<p>“ Sheltered with but a beggar poor,<br />
And all alone had come to thee<br />
In poverty to try thy door,<br />
To test thy faith and loyalty,<br />
And found thee constant still to me,<br />
Sure thou shouldst never rue the day!<br />
But for thy fealty, thou shouldst be<br />
The king when I had passed away.”</p>
<p>Then all who sat within the hall<br />
Knew that it was the king aright.<br />
The steward ran to him, to fall<br />
Down at his feet in dumb delight,<br />
And all his lordings at the sight<br />
Crowded about his feet, to cling<br />
And shout for joy with all their might,<br />
“ Thou art our lord, sir, and our king ! “</p>
<p>Sure all were glad when they had heard;<br />
Quickly they led him in with glee,<br />
And bathed his face and shaved his beard<br />
And tired him as a king should be;<br />
And then with mirth and jollity<br />
They brought the queen into the town,<br />
With every sort of minstrelsy!<br />
Lord, how the tale went up and down!</p>
<p>For very joy the people wept<br />
That he was come so safe and sound;<br />
For very joy they danced and leapt;<br />
His soul was healed of every wound;<br />
Again Sir Orfeo was crowned;<br />
Again sweet Heurodis was queen;<br />
In love they lived, till death they found;<br />
Then the steward ruled their wide demesne.</p>
<p>In Britain, after many a day,<br />
The harpers learned this wondrous thing,<br />
And made thereof this pleasant lay,<br />
And named it for the harper-king.<br />
And so of Orfeo I sing:<br />
Good is the lay, and sweet the air;<br />
Thus cometh mirth from sorrowing, —<br />
God grant us all as well to fare.</p>

<p>NOTES</p>
<p>LAY</p>
<p>Sir Orfeo</p>
<p>This Middle English version of a French lay seems to offer so few difficulties that it is given in its original form, as it appears in the Auchinleck manuscript. The text is copied from that edited by Laing in “ Select Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland,” reprinted in Edinburgh, 1884. A critical edition of the poem was published by O. Zielke, Breslau, 1880. A very charming free translation in stanza form has been made by E. E. Hunt, Cambridge, 1909.</p>
<p>“ Sir Orfeo “ is the mediaeval interpretation of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice (Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” bk. x, 11.1-77), which was told in French, and then translated by some nameless but immortal English poet. The beauty of this Middle English version is undeniable. Despite its brevity and its occasionally laconic phrases, the poem shows real pathos in the account of the passionate grief of Orfeo, and his desolate wanderings in search of his lady. The concrete vividness of color and fragrance in nature, the dim stateliness of the retinue of the king of fairyland, the magic beauty of his strange abode, are described with true poetic sensitiveness. In choice of detail, in management of incident, in “ discovery,” and in conclusion the narrative is singularly well managed.</p>
<p>As a mediaeval rendering of a classical tale, the poem has many charms, because it so naively and so completely changes the setting and insists upon mediaeval towers and dress and customs. Pluto’s dark realm is transformed into a fairy kingdom, Thrace has become Winchester, and the wandering Greek is a Breton harper knocking at the door of a Gothic castle. As a version of one of the most beautiful of the world’s stories, this lay has true imaginative distinction ; it pictures the loyalty of love and love’s power over time and fairy spells, but it willfully changes the outcome of the old story to suit the sentiment of high romance in an age when every tale must have a happy ending.</p>

Select remains of the ancient popular poetry of Scotland
by Laing, David, 1793-1878</p>
<p>Publication date 1822</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Herken,</span> <span class="pre">lordyngys,</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">ben</span> <span class="pre">trewe.</span>&#160;&#160; </code>And Y wol you telle of fir Orphewe.’</p>
<p>THE fairy tale of <em>Orfeo and Heurodis</em> is possessed of a very distinct, though not less interesting character, from the numerous remains of early Romantic fiction. In the concluding lines it professes to be a lay of Bretaigne, but whether a translation or not, there can be no doubt that it was formed on the classical story of <em>Orpheus and Eurydice</em>. This tale was extensively known at an early period, owing to the circulation of the Latin poets and the works of other ancient authors in which it has been so beautifully narrated. In proof of this, Mr. Turner, in his valuable and instructive history has shewn, that during the 11th century, King Alfred, when translating the Metrum to the <em>Consolations of Philosophy</em>, in his Anglo-Saxon version of Boethius, where the incident is described in a general manner, by that popular writer, has told “ the story so completely in his own way, and with so many of his own little touches and additions, as to make his account an original tale <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[History</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Anglo-Saxons,</span> <span class="pre">vol.</span> <span class="pre">ii.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">157,</span> <span class="pre">edit.</span> <span class="pre">1820.]</span></code>.” In the present instance, the narrative, (as observed by a distinguished writer of our times, who, in a felicitous manner, has employed it to illustrate a highly interesting Essay on the <em>Fairies of Popular Superstition</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Minstrelsy</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Scottish</span> <span class="pre">Border,</span> <span class="pre">vol.</span> <span class="pre">ii.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">174.</span> <span class="pre">edit.</span> <span class="pre">1803.]</span></code>) has been transformed into a beautiful romantic tale of Faery, in which the Gothick Mythology and the usages of Chivalry are with singular skill engrafted on the fables of Greece.</p>
<p>Among the pleysand storeis enumerated in <em>The Complaynt of Scotland</em>, 1549, as being popular, is <em>Opheus, kyng of Portingal</em>; but no romance of this particular title is known. Therefore, it is more than probable that it might be some corruption of the present story; as we know how little stress should be laid on the geographical correctness, or consistency of the Minstrel-writers. Thus in the following tale, we have Orfeo represented as King of Winchester, the ancient name of which, ‘ the Romancer, with unparalled ingenuity, discovers to have been Traciens or Thrace:’ <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Minstrelsy</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Scottish</span> <span class="pre">Border,</span> <span class="pre">vol.</span> <span class="pre">ii.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">203.]</span></code> and, in the burlesque interlude of the laying of a gaist, printed in this collection, the Gaist is married to ‘ the Spenzie flie’ —</p>
<p>And crownd him kyng of Kandelie ;<br />
And thay gat them thame betwene<br />
Orpheus Kyng, and Elpha quene.’</p>
<p>The story of Orpheus and Eurydice, in the latter part of the fifteenth Century, was moralized by Robert Henryson, the Scotish poet. It was first printed at Edinburgh, in the year 1508, with the title <em>Heir begynnis the traitie of Orpheus kyng, and how he geid to hewyn ? to hel to feik his quene</em>. After detailing, with minute fidelity to his classical authorities, the genealogy and history of the King of Thrace, Henryson introduces, in a different kind of measure, the ‘<em>mone lamentable</em>’ of Orpheus, beginning</p>
<p>O dulfull harpe ! with mony dolly string<br />
Tume all thi mirth and musik in murnyng<br />
And cess of all the sub tell sangis sweit—</p>
<p>After this pathetic lamentation, the poet having related his visit to the celestial spheres, conducts him to the infernal regions in search of Eurydice. From this part of Henryson’s performance a few stanzas, by way of specimen, maybe given.</p>
<p>He passit furth the space of xx. dayis,<br />
Fer and full ferthcr than I can tell,<br />
And ay he fand stretis and ledy wayis,<br />
Tyll at the last, vnto the yett of hell<br />
He com ; and thare he fand a portar fell<br />
With thre hedis, was callit Cerberus ;<br />
A hund of hell, a monster meruailus !</p>
<p>He charms Cerberus and then the ‘ three sisters,’ Alecto, Megera, and Thesiphoné, whose employment was turning round the wheel on which Ixion was spread. ‘ Syne,’ — the poet says,—</p>
<p>Syne come he till a wonder grisely flud,<br />
Droubly and depe, that rathly doun can ryn,<br />
Quhare Tantalus nakit full thristy stude.<br />
And yit the water yede abone his chyn ;<br />
Thouch he gapit thare wald na drop cum in,<br />
Quhen he dulkit the water wald descend ;<br />
Thus gat he noucht his thrist to slake or mend.</p>
<p>Before his face ane apill hang also<br />
Fast at his mouth apon a tolter threde,<br />
Quhen he gapit it rokkit to and fro<br />
And fled, as it reftisit hym to fede :<br />
Than Orpheus had reuth of his grete nede<br />
Tuke out his harp, and fast on it can clink,<br />
The water stude, and Tantalus gat drink.</p>
<p>The next object which presents itself in his progress, is Theseus preyed on by a ‘ grisely gripe’ or vulture, which also excites the compassion of Orpheus. On entering ‘ hydouse hellis house’ he exclaims,</p>
<p>O dolly place and groundles depe dungeoun !<br />
Furnes of fyre, with stynk intollerable.<br />
Pit of dispair, wythout remissioun,<br />
Thy mete venym, thy drynk is poysonable.<br />
Thy grete panis to compt vnnowmerabil ;<br />
Quhat creature cummys to duel in the<br />
Is ay deyand, and newir more may dee ‘.</p>
<p>We must pass over the different personages whom he here beholds, in order to make room for the description of his meeting with Eurydice.</p>
<p>Syn nethir mare he went quhare Pluto was<br />
And Proserpine, and thider ward he drewe,<br />
Ay play and on his harp as he coud pas,<br />
Till at the last Eurydice he knewe ;<br />
Lene and dedelike pitouse and pale of hewe,<br />
Rycht warsch and wan, and walowit as a wede,<br />
Hir lily lyre was lyke vnto the lede.</p>
<p>Quod he, my lady lele, and my delyte,<br />
Full wa is me, to se yow changit thus!<br />
Quhare is thy rude as rose with chekis quhite ?<br />
Thy cristall eyne with blenkis amorouse ?<br />
Thi lippis rede to kis deliciouse ? —<br />
Quod scho, as now I dar noucht tell, perfay,<br />
Bot ye sail wit the cause ane other day.</p>
<p>The present tale has been justly admired no less for the harmony of its versification, than for the beautiful description which it contains of Fairy-land. Heurodis is carried away by the king of the Fairies, whose attendants are as numerous as his riches and magnifieence are dazzling ; and is recovered by Orfeo in the disguise of a Minstrel. The following lines, which occur in one of the ancient copies of thus poem, (but apparently omitted by the transcriber of the manuscript that is followed) may be quoted, as illustrative of Orfeo’s skill, and love of Minstrelsy.</p>
<p>“ Orpheo most of ony thing,<br />
Liovede the gle of harpyng ;<br />
Syker was every gode harpourc<br />
Of hym to have moche honour.<br />
Hymself loved for to harpe,<br />
And layde thereon his wittes scharpe ;<br />
He lerned so, ther non was<br />
A better harper in no plas.<br />
In the world was never man born,<br />
That onus Orfeo sat biforn.<br />
And he myght of his harpyng her.<br />
He shulde thinke that he wer<br />
In one of the joys of paradys,<br />
Suche joy and melody in his harpyng is.”</p>
<p>The reader will perceive that in this story the catastrophe is different; but if less pathetic, it certainly is more agreeable than that of the classical fiction.</p>
<p>At some later period this romantic legend appears to have been considerably altered and abridged. In such a state it is preserved in a Manuscript in the Harleian collection <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[MSS.</span> <span class="pre">Harl.</span> <span class="pre">no.</span> <span class="pre">3810.]</span></code>, from which it was published by Ritson <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Ancient</span> <span class="pre">English</span> <span class="pre">Metrical</span> <span class="pre">Romances,</span> <span class="pre">vol.</span> <span class="pre">ii.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">248-269,</span> <span class="pre">1802,</span> <span class="pre">8vo.]</span></code>. The present copy is taken from the more ancient volume in the Advocates’ Library, called, from its donor, the Auchinleck Manuscript. The period of its composition may be referred to the beginning of the fourteenth century; as the volume which contains it was evidently written during the minority of Edward III. From this early, and precious record of Ancient Poetry the text is given literally, except that a few useless contractions are discarded, which might only have served to perplex the reader. As Ritson’s collection, which contains the story in its more recent and somewhat compendious state is by no means of rare occurrence, it was thought unnecessary to point out any of the variations. The prologue that there accompanies it is not found in the Auchinleck manuscript: yet, as the leaf immediately before the first line</p>
<p>‘ Orfeo was a king’</p>
<p>has been torn out for the sake of the illumination, it is possible that it may not have begun so abruptly ; — even although the commencement of another poem in the volume is in substance the same with that of the ‘ Sir Orfeo’ in the Harleian manuscript, which in all consists of 510 lines <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Lai</span> <span class="pre">le</span> <span class="pre">Fraine,</span> <span class="pre">printed</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Weber's</span> <span class="pre">Collection.]</span></code>. It may be added that a correspondent in the British Bibliographer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Vol.</span> <span class="pre">iv.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">18</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">95.]</span></code>, states, that in a manuscript volume in the Ashmolean Collection at Oxford, is preserved a copy of the romance of ‘ King Orfeo’ altogether different from the translation published by Ritson. Possibly it might be found on comparison to come nearer to that which is now given.</p>

<p>SIR ORPHEO.</p>
<p>This lay, or tale, being rather too concise to be denominated a metrical romance, is a Gothick metamorphosis of the classical episode of Orpheus and Eurydice, so beautifully related by Ovid. It professes, like the tales of Mary of France, to be a lay of Britain, (whether Great Britain or Armorica, has been already discussed) ; and, if it have not so much merit as some others of these poetical compositions, the most fastidious reader can scarcely complain of its prolixity. There are two copies of this poem ; one, from which it was transcribed, among the Harleian manuscripts, number 3810; and another in the Auchinleck manuscript (W. 4. i. number lii), in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh : each more or less imperfect. The latter, which omits the prologue, and commences abruptly,<br />
“ Orpheo was a ryche king,”<br />
is much longer than the poem here printed, which seems abridged from it, by considerable omissions, many of the remaining lines being the same : but whether it be a translation from a French original (which, at least, is sufficiently probable) there is no means to ascertain. Another fragment in the same MS. (num. xxxv), though upon a different subject, begins precisely like the Harleian copy, but is entitled <em>Lay le freine</em> (the Tale of the Ash), and, apparently, a version of Mary’s poem under the same title.</p>
<p>Among the “pleysand storeis,” enumerated in <em>The Complaynt of Scotland</em>, 1549, is “Opheus, kyng of Portingal :” but whether the name should have been Orpheus, and the story were the same, or a different one, cannot be ascertained. “A tedious fable,” according to Pinkerton, “by [Robert] Henryson, with a spiritual moralization,” of “Orpheus kyng, and how he ycid to hewyn and to hel to seik his quene,” was printed at Edinburgh by Walter Chepman, in 1508. In an old poem of “the laying of a gaist,” quoted, by Mr. Leyden, from the Bannatyne MS. the “gaist” is married to “the Spenzie Hie,</p>
<p>And crownd him kyng of Kandelie ;<br />
And thay gat them betwene<br />
<em>Orpheus king</em>, and <em>Elpha quene</em>.”</p>

# Sir Orfeo

A mediaeval retelling of the myh of *Orpheus and Eurydice*, which I've used a coiple of timrs to frame the sinking of HMS Eurydice (see ??), recast as a tale of a proud (and not in a good way!) knight who is beset by misfortune and who sets out to recover his wife who is kidnapped into the land of Faerie.
